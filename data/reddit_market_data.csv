1756536828.0,IndiaInvestments,Nifty vs Nasdaq CAGR (2015–2025): Why US Companies Still Outperform India,"\*\*Note:\*\*This is a raw comment addressing the question of why I suggest investing in the US even if the economy is considered “declining.”

Full Comment:

So Nifty 50 CAGR for the last decade from 1 Jan 2015 is 11-13%, and Nasdaq CAGR is 15-17%. Don’t get trapped in the marketing shit by media and governments across the globe.

The US has and creates floating companies like Meta, Uber, Airbnb,Booking, Domino’s, McDonald’s, Mastercard, Visa, Coke, Pepsi, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet, Amazon, YouTube, even Reddit, Nvidia, and ChatGPT. Android, iOS, X, Y, Z, and countless others. The list is endless.

These companies have floating business models and lack geographical restrictions. Just think, 90-95% of your life, your time, and your money is consumed by US companies. And it’s not about the US itself, it’s about the business model. Most of these companies happen to be created and listed in the US.

Indian companies rarely have this floating nature. So even at a lower base and in one of the best decades of growth, we were not able to outperform them. It’s not about the country but about individual business models and their compounding power.

Meta grows at 40-45% on a $1.5-2 trillion market cap and trades at 25 PE. Indian companies of $10-15 billion struggle to grow at 7-8% and trade at 100-120 PE.

Nvidia grows at 50-100%. Mastercard and Visa control 60-70% of our financial ecosystem. Around 70% of index and ETF networks of India are built on MSCI, which is also a US company. So one needs to be rational and focus on individual business models.

US companies can extend their lifecycles because of their floating DNA. Indian companies face threats from geographical constraints, but US companies don’t, at least the ones worth investing in and compounding.

You might be using Apple or Android for reading this, and both ecosystems are from the US.

The platforms that democratize and give access to technology and consume 90% of our time and money across every category, whether it is Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube for social things, or Microsoft, Salesforce, and its ecosystem for professional work, are all US companies, not Indian.

It’s laughable when media says the US is dead and a declining power and it’s India’s decade. In reality, these companies are making more money from India and are the real beneficiaries of the India decade. People just don’t use their brains and do real research.

I can say with high conviction that investors should diversify globally and hedge country risk, because individual business models matter more than the country itself.

Personally, I stay selective and invest based on the quality of companies rather than their geography by screening them on the high quality checklist. 

If you found this valuable, you can refer to more advanced frameworks on r/IndiaGrowthStocks
 
Also curious to hear your thoughts: US or India, which do you think will compound better over the long term?

So Nifty 50 CAGR for the last decade from 1 Jan 2015 is 11-13%, and Nasdaq CAGR is 15-17%. Don’t get trapped in the marketing shit by media and governments across the globe.

The US has and creates floating companies like Meta, Uber, Airbnb,Booking, Domino’s, McDonald’s, Mastercard, Visa, Coke, Pepsi, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet, Amazon, YouTube, even Reddit, Nvidia, and ChatGPT. Android, iOS, X, Y, Z, and countless others. The list is endless.

These companies have floating business models and lack geographical restrictions. Just think, 90-95% of your life, your time, and your money is consumed by US companies. And it’s not about the US itself, it’s about the business model. Most of these companies happen to be created and listed in the US.

Indian companies rarely have this floating nature. So even at a lower base and in one of the best decades of growth, we were not able to outperform them. It’s not about the country but about individual business models and their compounding power.

Meta grows at 40-45% on a $1.5-2 trillion market cap and trades at 25 PE. Indian companies of $10-15 billion struggle to grow at 7-8% and trade at 100-120 PE.

Nvidia grows at 50-100%. Mastercard and Visa control 60-70% of our financial ecosystem. Around 70% of index and ETF networks of India are built on MSCI, which is also a US company. So one needs to be rational and focus on individual business models.

US companies can extend their lifecycles because of their floating DNA. Indian companies face threats from geographical constraints, but US companies don’t, at least the ones worth investing in and compounding.

You might be using Apple or Android for reading this, and both ecosystems are from the US.

The platforms that democratize and give access to technology and consume 90% of our time and money across every category, whether it is Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube for social things, or Microsoft, Salesforce, and its ecosystem for professional work, are all US companies, not Indian.

It’s laughable when media says the US is dead and a declining power and it’s India’s decade. In reality, these companies are making more money from India and are the real beneficiaries of the India decade. People just don’t use their brains and do real research.

I can say with high conviction that investors should diversify globally and hedge country risk, because individual business models matter more than the country itself.

Personally, I stay selective and invest based on the quality of companies rather than their geography by screening them on the high quality checklist. 

If you found this valuable, you can refer to more advanced frameworks on r/IndiaGrowthStocks
 
Also curious to hear your thoughts: US or India, which do you think will compound better over the long term?

1731668701.0,IndiaInvestments,Is a 12% Annualized Return on Nifty 50 Realistic Over the Long Term?,"A common investment tip is to put money in equity, like Nifty 50 or similar mutual funds, through either a lump sum or SIP, and hold for the long term (15-20 years) to achieve annualized returns of around 10-15%.

Using the compound interest formula:

* Final Value = Initial Value × (1 + r)\^t
* Where: Initial Value = **24,000** (current Nifty value), r = **12%** (0.12), and t = **20 years**
* Target Value = **231,504**

This calculation suggests that if someone invests a lump sum amount in Nifty 50 today and leaves it untouched for 20 years, Nifty would need to reach around 231,504!!! to yield a 12% annualized return.

1756261484.0,IndiaInvestments,Swiggy OUT of Nifty Next 50 INDEX in September 2025 reshuffle,"
NSE has announced the latest NN50 reshuffle, effective September 30, 2025.

🟢 In (new entries to NN50):
	•	Hindustan Zinc
	•	Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders
	•	Siemens Energy India
	•	Solar Industries India

🔴 Out (leaving NN50):
	•	Dabur India → moving to Nifty Midcap 150
	•	ICICI Prudential Life Insurance → moving to Nifty Midcap 150
	•	InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) → promoted to Nifty 50
	•	Swiggy → moving to Nifty Midcap 150 

Swiggy got into Nifty Next 50 in March 2025 and is already out by September. Do you think this was just hype + early inclusion, or a sign that the market isn’t convinced about its growth yet? With Swiggy now shifting to Nifty Midcap 150, is this a buying opportunity or a red flag?

1723041678.0,IndiaInvestments,ETFs vs Index Fund (or Niftybees vs UTI Nifty Fund) Whcih is better?? ,"I have done a lot of reading on this. But I'm unable to see why would anyone ever want to invest in Index Funds over ETFs for the long term (> 5 yrs). Can someone, preferably from personal experience, tell are there hidden costs with ETFs that will later come to bite me (I'm attaching a comparison from NSE Passive funds website and it's clear ETFs >> Index Fund).  

Also I'm an investing in super liquid ETFs. Basically classic portfolio (100 INR):

1713705626.0,IndiaInvestments,Investing equal amount in each of the Nifty Top 750 Indexes. ,"I am more of an invest and forget kind of investor and also have a larger risk appetite.

I have earmarked a certain amount for SIP each month. I am planning to invest 20% of it each in:

* Nifty 50 Index Fund
* Nifty Next 50 Index Fund
* Nifty Midcap 150 Index Fund
* Nifty Smallcap 250 Index Fund
* Nifty Microcap 250 Index Fund

I am looking to choose this method instead of going for a Total Market Index fund because (due to the market cap related weightage) the Total Market Index is heavily dominated by the Nifty50 Index.

The main benefits of my approach (according to me) are:

1. Invest and forget. No doubting whether I chose the right AMC or the right actively managed fund. I will be taking a bet directly on long term potential of the entire Indian market doing well.
2. If I choose an actively managed fund, I will always keep looking at the portfolio and comparing it with the index to see if I made the correct decision.
3. I will save tons of time which I would have otherwise spent looking at charts, expense rations, comparison etc. This time will definitely be better spent on other things like increasing my main source of income.
4. There is going to be a downturn sooner of later and we do not know how most actively managed funds will handle this.

Is there anything obvious which I might have missed around this approach?",88,74,"Investing equal amount in each of the Nifty Top 750 Indexes.  I am more of an invest and forget kind of investor and also have a larger risk appetite.

1620819717.0,IndiaInvestments,Returns: LIC vs Gold vs Nifty,"Recently my father's LIC Money back policy policy matured and he received a return of around 126000 INR, although he considered this a success even after investing an amount 6560 every year for 20 years, I was skeptical around the return.

So I decided to compare that with returns of other famous investment vehicles like Nifty 50 and Gold.

There was a moneyback from the policy every 5 years considering that, here is the result of such comparison from 2001 to 2021

**Summary:**

Return on Gold : 12%

Return on Nifty: 15%

Return on LIC: 5%

(calculation attached with [G Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRIk18XIZS9JhP8TnAjFdTbKqTYME3vcEAA2FRl6OKoI5_ZuICzje6KtgAuKS9qNmoMxkzglYXCElYe/pubhtml#)

**Note:** The comparison is made with absolute data based on actual dates and values

If you want to calculate the same for your ULIP/ LIC, here are the steps to follow:

1. get Nifty date wise NAV from VRO

2. Gold price date wise from Google

3. LIC returns in actual 

4. feed to a spread sheet like Excel and use XIRR formulae

1746871236.0,IndiaInvestments,Comparison of broad Indian index funds which track Nifty 500 or Nifty 750 (Total Market),"Quite a few new funds have been launched in this category, so thought I would do a comparison. Some comments on the table:

* Most of the funds were launched in 2024/2025, with the exception of HDFC, Groww (both 2023) and Motilal Oswal (2009) is the ""grandad"" of the bunch
* AUM - many of the new funds have only 20\~30 Cr in AUM; Two funds that stand out here are Motilal with 2100 Cr. and SBI with 800 Cr. Tier-2 seems to be Axis , HDFC and Groww all around 200\~300 Cr.
* Expense ratio - the best one is Axis at 0.10%, followed by Mirae at 0.14%; Tier-2 is Motilal and Angel One at 0.2%\~0.28%; Rest are 0.3%\~0.4%; For comparison , you can buy the cheapest Nifty 50 index funds at 0.05%\~0.10% expense ratio
* Tracking error - Several of these are too new (ICICI, Mirae, Bandhan, Angel One) to have reliable Tracking error data yet. But ones that have been around for some time have a tracking error of 0.1%\~0.2%; For comparison, the best Nifty 50 index funds have tracking error of 0.05% \~ 0.10%
* Performance of the benchmarks (500 or 750 indices) has been slightly better than Nifty 50 (+2\~3% annually) over the last five years, even though small/mid-caps have corrected in the last year
* My conclusion: A broader index (500 or 750) seems to be a better way to get exposure to Indian equities; My pick of the bunch (for now) would be Motilal Oswal, given their long operating record and AUM; However, this should be reviewed in 1\~2 years when we have enough time to gauge the other funds' performance and tracking errors

In terms of options for Retail investors, Motilal Oswal seems to have the highest AUM in Nifty 500 Index funds - it has also outperformed the Nifty 50 and Nifty 100 index funds over all the time periods since it was created (even after considering their higher expense ratio). Hopefully , their expense ratio will improve in the future, as the AUM increases. I used to invest in the Nifty 100 for my passive investments, but have shifted to the Nifty 500 now.

1612394785.0,IndiaInvestments,How unrealistic is expecting 1% per day gain in serious active intraday trading ?,"Total noob here, and I must confess also totally blinded by monetary needs.

A little background first. Currently working in one of those shiitty soul-sucking 9-5 jobs for a pay of measly 15k a month, while watching people doing less than me getting twice as much, just makes me wanna give up. Covid wasn't really kind for me, and currently I'm finding it hard to make end meet with what I earn, also have a family to feed. Have somehow managed to save up a few bucks over working for 3 years, and afraid I'll start depleting it soon.

I'm definitely missing a lot in my (very conservative) calculations, but I was wondering if I were to engage in intraday practice with a capital of about 50k, gaining on average 1% RoI per day for a month, that should net me a month's equivalent of salary ? I'll still be in the same financial stress, but I least I could save a bit of my soul by resigning.

----

I've begun researching since a week. Here's how I plan to trade :

* Select about 10 stocks with respectable per day volume trade.     
* Buy those daily, ofcourse, with stop-loss set at negative 0.5%.     
* Hold if they rise, ofcourse, till 1% gain.    
* After and if they've already gained 1%, sell them if they ever drop by 0.5%. (I've come across a term 'trailing stop-loss', and guessing this is what it means.)

----

#####Here's my other unorganised thoughts :

* Sometimes some stocks should be going beyond 1% gains.
* Even if I make a 100% red trades, per day whole month. I stand to lose 7.5k worth of capital + trading charges + losses for orders not executing on time for whatever reason. A hefty amount, but what I'm willing to risk.    
* Optimistically, the above should minimise my losses and help me towards crossing that 1% barrier.    
* I do have my wits and fully trust them. Actually it's only my wits that I have. I'm fully committed to make this work, whatever it takes.    
* What trading platform would give the most reliable intraday trading experience. Thinking of going with Zerodha, even though this sub generally disagrees with using Z for this kind of operation. Chose Z only because this sub doesn't seem to have a favorite for intraday activities.    
* Had a few more things on my mind, but can't recollect them right now.    
* Oh yeah, and I'm using Varsity to educate myself better, plan on cleaning up my entire twitter/youtube feed and refilling it with just investment/finance related contents. As a means to immerse myself.    
* Will be going all-in not before I get a good grasp on technical analysis, will be trading with low 2-5k capital meanwhile. With the first objective to not lose it all, and second objective to realise 1% goal for 2 months straight before I start pumping in more cash up till 50k *~~hopefully and possibly beyond~~*.

I'm here for a second opinion. Looking for stuff I overlooked.

###Update 1 :

So, this post was flagged by automod and wasn't visible on the sub when I posted. Probably a real mod approved it later (thanks!). Which is why I wasn't here checking up the comments, came here just now to repost this and just to see that I've already been well advised. I'll be going through the comments in few hours after I get back home. Thank you to everyone that participated.

On a glance, I've saw a comment I'll like to address : I've already considered that fact that if it were so easy, everyone would be doing it. Therefore, this argument doesn't really change anything in my thought process. Should've made this comment under the list of my unorganised thoughts.

And to another comment that goes something like : 90% people lose money in intraday : Well what's stopping me from belonging in the other 10% ? That's what I actually came here to know.

Nifty Index - 12246 - Jan 10 2020

This is roughly a 13% return per year ignoring dividends.


Gold price - Jan 2005 - Rs 6420 for 10 gms  
Gold price - Today - Rs 39607   

This is roughly a 12.9% return per year.  

Nifty dividends come to around 1.3% year, I think.   
If you buy something like Sovereign Gold Bonds, you get 2.5% interest per year.  

If you hold SGBs till maturity there is no capital gains tax unlike buying & selling the index. Also if you buy SGB from the secondary market, you can buy it at a discount as compared to a current SGB.    

I think everybody should have gold in their portfolio, somewhere between 10-20%. 

I think abroad gold is just a hedge, but in India considering both gold prices & also the weakening of the rupee, it becomes a double play & it seems to be a good investment also.",49,90,"Gold vs Nifty returns over the last 15 years Nifty Index - 1952 - Jan 11 2005

1681366634.0,IndiaInvestments,Don't Miss Out on the Latest Real Estate Investment Opportunity in India! NSE Launches Nifty REITs and InvITs Index," 

I'm excited to share some groundbreaking news for real estate investors in India. NSE Indices, a subsidiary of NSE index services, has just launched the Nifty REITs and InvITs Index, the first-ever index of its kind in India.

As an experienced real estate investor, I believe the Nifty REITs and InvITs Index is a game-changer for the Indian market. It provides a unique opportunity to diversify our investment portfolios with income-generating assets in the real estate and infrastructure sectors these are notes by Mukesh Agrawal, CEO, NSE Indices.

Imagine having access to a benchmark that tracks the performance of publicly listed and traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) on the NSE. The index is weighted based on market capitalization, with a cap of 33% per security and an average weight of the top 3 securities capped at 72%. It's reviewed and rebalanced quarterly to keep it up-to-date.

REITs and InvITs have gained popularity worldwide as attractive investment options. The launch of the Nifty REITs and InvITs Index in India opens up new possibilities for investors looking for diversification and regular income

But here's the best part - REITs and InvITs are recognized as powerful financial instruments that offer investors exposure to diversified, regular income-generating real estate and infrastructure assets.

The launch of the Nifty REITs and InvITs Index aligns with NSE's vision to provide market representative benchmarks for different asset classes. It's a game-changer for real estate investors in India, presenting a new and exciting opportunity to explore the potential of REITs and InvITs in the Indian market.

1704202869.0,IndiaInvestments,Why are large-cap index funds like Sensex / Nifty 50 more popular than broader ones like NSE 500 / BSE 500 in India? (whereas the S&P500 is by far the most tracked index in the US),"There are only 3 funds I found that track the 500 largest Indian cos (shown below). These funds have very low AUMs (\~600 Cr. for Motilal - which is the largest of the 3) vs. the largest index funds in the country which have AUMs around 10,000 Cr.\~13,000 Cr. 

I know these broader funds are newer, and their expense ratios are a bit higher, but I would have expected a higher uptake, as these funds can give you exposure to the whole market in one instrument rather than having to but multiple funds across small/mid-cap/large-cap.

The 3 broad-based index fund options:

As you can see below, mid and small caps form around 30% of the market, and the largest indices will miss out on approx. 1600 of the smallest companies, some of which will go on to become 10 and 100 baggers in the future. So, the additional expense ratio for a broad-based index fund may well be worth the money?

&#x200B;

A week before someone has commented that instead of doing SIP of Nifty 50 mutual fund, he/she does lumpsum whenever the market dips by atleast 2%. Considering the today's market dip, is it a wise decision to buy lumpsum?

What is your opinion on this? I have been doing SIP in Nifty 50 and Motilal Oswal S&P 500 mutual funds since an year and never thought about this approach.

[Today I got some data at my hand  showing why investing in NITFY ETF via the SIP mode is better than investing in Mutual Funds via the SIP mode ... at least for the past 12-14 months.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ouEPIp1YAs4ytZSGKc7l1GK2aScb0xVU8A-xiMdRcEE/edit?usp=sharing)

An old colleague of mine contacted me saying his is not happy with his MF performance. I asked him to send me his SIP schedule and amount. **I added a third sheet for NIFTY ETF. He was suggested the large cap and mid cap fund by an advisor (paid advisor)**.

TLDR:

* Return from SIP in Large Cap MF = 4.4%
* Return from SIP in Mid Cap MF = -7.2%
* Return from SIP in NIFTY ETF = 12.6%

Also, no research is required for NIFTY ETF so one can save on advisory fees too.

Edit:

As /u/NamitNasih mentioned below, this is just 2 funds for the period of 1 year. So it may not be the most accurate comparison but mutual fund investors who have been investing via the SIP route should augment the above mentioned spreadsheet and compare their SIP performance with the NIFTYBEES's SIP performance over the same period. (Compare  actual data and returns they got after fees and not just the return number provided by the fund house.)

And if people send me their spreadsheets then I will be happy to collate it under one sheet for the benefit of all users.",14,71,"MF SIP vs NIFTY ETF SIP As you are aware I am a big proponent of investing via SIP in NIFTY ETF (NIFTYBEES).

What do you think?",nifty pe ratio record high level think stock market still go higher current levels pe ratio reaching historically rare event right personally think good time longterm investor nifty perhaps major stock index world ever sustained long levels without going major correction bear run shortly afterwards think,0.16097402597402596,Hold,1.5861346715939972,Buy,25.68829220015216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18430602916258856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17139840822868893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330932221602341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16395026849030722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14090360842919214,0.0,0.0,0.12835119024168298,0.0,0.11309542634850595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10804794377682542,0.12493902035791109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18064977602143867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08710930837397661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14765105978304577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320967603557364,0.28432295847046485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12033008961760937,0.16395026849030722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2747200359805208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584569121739831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12905408904191792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29530211956609154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18430602916258856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27937135369710553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14090360842919214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385052260940825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14620327956671833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12180571856295107,0.0,0.1779619564702776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37982153942376917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070110800491278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15771577866254177,0.0,0.0,0.17139840822868893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am Vishal Jain. I have over 25 years of experience in financial services building Index Funds and ETFs.

Passive investing in India is about to take a giant leap forward. For too long, investors have had to choose between different asset classes, manually building and rebalancing their portfolios. We believe there's a simpler, more effective way.I'm thrilled to announce our first offering in this new landscape: **Zerodha Multi Asset Passive FoF.**

It is designed to give simple yet effective allocation across four key segments i.e. equity largecap, equity midcap,  gold & g-sec. The goal is to provide a single tax efficient solution for a long-term portfolio. One investment that does the heavy lifting of diversification and rebalancing, so you can free up your time and mind to focus on what matters most to you.

Feel free to ask me anything about this fund or any other questions you have about Zerodha Fund House.

I have taken SIP start date as 01/01/2014 as many funds direct plan starts in 2012-2013 years so this should serve as good start. I know tenure is short to judge MF performance but we have direct plans since 2012-13. Since all of us here invest is direct plans anyways so performance comparison of regular plan is moot here.

1532762148.0,IndiaInvestments,Nifty Smallcap 100. The biggest collapse and the biggest opportunity in last 6 years.,"28th July 2018

Hello India investments,

I'm back again with my analysis  and thought process in the current market.

I had posted here in end of January and also end of may regarding what's happening with Smallcap and Midcap index.

The correction has been brutal in Nifty Smallcap 100, which fell from 9657 to 6923 on 19th July 2018. That's a drop of whopping 28.4 percent.

The story is similar in NIFTY Midcap 100. It crashed roughly 24 percent.

The correction was so brutal that in Nifty Smallcap 100, only 14 stocks were above 200 DMA and 86 were well below, most 50 percent below.

If my memory serves me correct, before the last elections in 2014, there was an almighty collapse in NIFTY Smallcap of 32 percent. And that was the time I picked up some gems which gave me multibagger returns.

I personally feel that this correction has been brutally overdone and a lot of great companies are avlaible now at PE of 3 to 10. As thus, instead of fear, we should be picking up and selecting the new multibaggers.

I'm especially bullish on Ruchira Paper, Joindre, Rain Industries, Avanti Feeds, uflex, thirumalai chem, redington, imfa, jm financial, Phillips carbon, pfc, REC, tinplate, vedanta, capital first and also LEEL.

Most of these stocks have great managements except LEEL and the PE reflects that. Others have been hammered.

Amy opinions???

And any beaten down gems you see in the market with low PE and high EPS growth or revenue growth.

Thanks and best regards.

----------------------------

Sharing this article here as I feel it might be of interest to a lot of us who're invested into Adani group companies, either directly or indirectly through index funds. Or have parked extra cash or emergency funds into a debt fund lending to Adani companies. 

I'll share a summary of the report here, while you can read the full report at this link: https://hindenburgresearch.com/adani/

> Today we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the INR 17.8 trillion (U.S. $218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.

> Gautam Adani, Founder and Chairman of the Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly $120 billion, adding over $100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group’s 7 key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819% in that period.

> Our research involved speaking with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of the Adani Group, reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.

> Even if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.
    
> Key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing. 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported ‘current ratios’ below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.
    
> The group’s very top ranks and 8 of 22 key leaders are Adani family members, a dynamic that places control of the group’s financials and key decisions in the hands of a few. A former executive described the Adani Group as “a family business.”
    
> The Adani Group has previously been the focus of 4 major government fraud investigations which have alleged money laundering, theft of taxpayer funds and corruption, totaling an estimated U.S. $17 billion. Adani family members allegedly cooperated to create offshore shell entities in tax-haven jurisdictions like Mauritius, the UAE, and Caribbean Islands, generating forged import/export documentation in an apparent effort to generate fake or illegitimate turnover and to siphon money from the listed companies.
   
> Gautam Adani’s younger brother, Rajesh Adani, was accused by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) of playing a central role in a diamond trading import/export scheme around 2004-2005. The alleged scheme involved the use of offshore shell entities to generate artificial turnover. Rajesh was arrested at least twice over separate allegations of forgery and tax fraud. He was subsequently promoted to serve as Managing Director of Adani Group.
    
> Gautam Adani’s brother-in-law, Samir Vora, was accused by the DRI of being a ringleader of the same diamond trading scam and of repeatedly making false statements to regulators. He was subsequently promoted to Executive Director of the critical Adani Australia division.
    
> Gautam Adani’s elder brother, Vinod Adani, has been described by media as “an elusive figure”. He has regularly been found at the center of the government’s investigations into Adani for his alleged role in managing a network of offshore entities used to facilitate fraud.
    
> Our research, which included downloading and cataloguing the entire Mauritius corporate registry, has uncovered that Vinod Adani, through several close associates, manages a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities.
    
> We have identified 38 Mauritius shell entities controlled by Vinod Adani or close associates. We have identified entities that are also surreptitiously controlled by Vinod Adani in Cyprus, the UAE, Singapore, and several Caribbean Islands.
    
> Many of the Vinod Adani-associated entities have no obvious signs of operations, including no reported employees, no independent addresses or phone numbers and no meaningful online presence. Despite this, they have collectively moved billions of dollars into Indian Adani publicly listed and private entities, often without required disclosure of the related party nature of the deals.
    
> We have also uncovered rudimentary efforts seemingly designed to mask the nature of some of the shell entities. For example, 13 websites were created for Vinod Adani-associated entities; many were suspiciously formed on the same days, featuring only stock photos, naming no actual employees and listing the same set of nonsensical services, such as “consumption abroad” and “commercial presence”.
    
> The Vinod-Adani shells seem to serve several functions, including (1) stock parking / stock manipulation (2) and laundering money through Adani’s private companies onto the listed companies’ balance sheets in order to maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency.
    
> Publicly listed companies in India are subject to rules that require all promoter holdings (known as insider holdings in the U.S.) to be disclosed. Rules also require that listed companies have at least 25% of the float held by non-promoters in order to mitigate manipulation and insider trading. 4 of Adani’s listed companies are on the brink of the delisting threshold due to high promoter ownership.
    
> Our research indicates that offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest “public” (i.e., non-promoter) holders of Adani stock, an issue that would subject the Adani companies to delisting, were Indian securities regulator SEBI’s rules enforced.
    
> Many of the supposed “public” funds exhibit flagrant irregularities such as being (1) Mauritius or offshore-based entities, often shells (2) with beneficial ownership concealed via nominee directors (3) and with little to no diversification, holding portfolios almost exclusively consisting of shares in Adani listed companies.
    
> Right to Information (RTI) requests we filed with SEBI confirm that the offshore funds are the subjects of an ongoing investigation, more than a year-and-a-half after concerns were initially raised by media and members of parliament.
    
> A former trader for Elara, an offshore fund with almost $3 billion in concentrated holdings of Adani shares, including a fund that is ~99% concentrated in shares of Adani, told us that it is obvious that Adani controls the shares. He explained that the funds are intentionally structured to conceal their ultimate beneficial ownership.
    
> Leaked emails show that the CEO of Elara worked on deals with Dharmesh Doshi, a fugitive accountant who worked closely on stock manipulation deals with Ketan Parekh, an infamous Indian market manipulator. The emails indicate that the CEO of Elara worked with Doshi on stock deals after he evaded arrest and was widely known as a fugitive.
    
> Another firm called Monterosa Investment Holdings controls 5 supposedly independent funds that collectively hold over INR 360 billion (U.S. $4.5 billion) in shares of listed Adani companies, according to Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) data and Indian exchange data.
    
> Monterosa’s Chairman and CEO served as director in 3 companies alongside a fugitive diamond merchant who allegedly stole U.S. $1 billion before fleeing India. Vinod Adani’s daughter married the fugitive diamond merchant’s son.
    
> A once-related party entity of Adani invested heavily in one of the Monterosa funds that allocated to Adani Enterprises and Adani Power, according to corporate records, drawing a clear line between the Adani Group and the suspect offshore funds.
    
> Another Cyprus-based entity called New Leaina Investments until June-September 2021 owned over U.S. $420 million in Adani Green Energy shares, comprising ~95% of its portfolio. Parliamentary records show it was (and may still be) a shareholder of other Adani listed entities.
    
> New Leaina is operated by incorporation services firm Amicorp, which has worked extensively to aid Adani in developing its offshore entity network. Amicorp formed at least 7 Adani promoter entities, at least 17 offshore shells and entities associated with Vinod Adani, and at least 3 Mauritius-based offshore shareholders of Adani stock.
    
> Amicorp played a key role in the 1MDB international fraud scandal that resulted in U.S. $4.5 billion being siphoned from Malaysian taxpayers. Amicorp established ‘investment funds’ for the key perpetrators that were “simply a way to wash a client’s money through what looked like a mutual fund”, according to the book Billion Dollar Whale, which reported on the scandal.
    
> ‘Delivery volume’ is a unique daily data point that reports institutional investment flows. Our analysis found that offshore suspected stock parking entities accounted for up to 30%-47% of yearly ‘delivery volume’ in several Adani listed companies, a flagrant irregularity indicating that Adani stocks have likely been subject to ‘wash trading’ or other forms of manipulative trading via the suspect offshore entities.
    
> Evidence of stock manipulation in Adani listed companies shouldn’t come as a surprise. SEBI has investigated and prosecuted more than 70 entities and individuals over the years, including Adani promoters, for pumping Adani Enterprises’ stock.
    
> A 2007 SEBI ruling stated that ""the charges leveled against promoters of Adani that they aided and abetted Ketan Parekh entities in manipulating the scrip of Adani stand proved"". Ketan Parekh is perhaps India’s most notorious stock market manipulator. Adani Group entities originally received bans for their roles, but those were later reduced to fines, a show of government leniency toward the Group that has become a decades-long pattern.
    
> Per the 2007 investigation, 14 Adani private entities transferred shares to entities controlled by Parekh, who then engaged in blatant market manipulation. Adani Group responded to SEBI by arguing that it had dealt with Ketan Parekh to finance the start of its operations at Mundra port, seemingly suggesting that share sales via stock manipulation somehow constitutes a legitimate form of financing.
    
> As part of our investigation, we interviewed an individual who was banned from trading on Indian markets for stock manipulation via Mauritius-based funds. He told us that he knew Ketan Parekh personally, and that little has changed, explaining “all the previous clients are still loyal to Ketan and are still working with Ketan”.
    
> In addition to using offshore capital to park stock, we found numerous examples of offshore shells sending money through onshore private Adani companies onto listed public Adani companies.
    
> The funds then seem to be used to engineer Adani's accounting (whether by bolstering its reported profit or cash flows), cushioning its capital balances in order to make listed entities appear more creditworthy, or simply moved back out to other parts of the Adani empire where capital is needed.
    
> We also identified numerous undisclosed related party transactions by both listed and private companies, seemingly an open and repeated violation of Indian disclosure laws.
    
> In one instance, a Vinod Adani-controlled Mauritius entity with no signs of substantive operations lent INR 11.71 billion (U.S. ~$253 million at that time) to a private Adani entity which did not disclose it as being a related party loan. The private entity subsequently lent funds to listed entities, including INR 9.84 billion (U.S. $138 million at more recent substantially lower exchange rates) to Adani Enterprises.
    
> Another Vinod Adani-controlled Mauritius entity called Emerging Market Investment DMCC lists no employees on LinkedIn, has no substantive online presence, has announced no clients or deals, and is based out of an apartment in the UAE. It lent U.S. $1 billion to an Adani Power subsidiary.
    
> This offshore shell network also seems to be used for earnings manipulation. For example, we detail a series of transactions where assets were transferred from a subsidiary of listed Adani Enterprises to a private Singaporean entity controlled by Vinod Adani, without disclosure of the related party nature of these deals. Once on the books of the private entity, the assets were almost immediately impaired, likely helping the public entity avoid a material write-down and negative impact to net income.
    
> Adani Group’s obvious accounting irregularities and sketchy dealings seem to be enabled by virtually non-existent financial controls. Listed Adani companies have seen sustained turnover in the Chief Financial Officer role. For example, Adani Enterprises has had 5 chief financial officers over the course of 8 years, a key red flag indicating potential accounting issues.
    
> The independent auditor for Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas is a tiny firm called Shah Dhandharia. Shah Dhandharia seems to have no current website. Historical archives of its website show that it had only 4 partners and 11 employees. Records show it pays INR 32,000 (U.S. $435 in 2021) in monthly office rent. The only other listed entity we found that it audits has a market capitalization of about INR 640 million (U.S. $7.8 million).
    
> Shah Dhandharia hardly seems capable of complex audit work. Adani Enterprises alone has 156 subsidiaries and many more joint ventures and affiliates, for example. Further, Adani’s 7 key listed entities collectively have 578 subsidiaries and have engaged in a total of 6,025 separate related-party transactions in fiscal year 2022 alone, per BSE disclosures.
    
> The audit partners at Shah Dhandharia who respectively signed off on Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas’ annual audits were as young as 24 and 23 years old when they began approving the audits. They were essentially fresh out of school, hardly in a position to scrutinize and hold to account the financials of some of the largest companies in the country, run by one of its most powerful individuals.
    
> Gautam Adani has claimed in an interview to “have a very open mind towards criticism…Every criticism gives me an opportunity to improve myself.” Despite these claims, Adani has repeatedly sought to have critical journalists or commentators jailed or silenced through litigation, using his immense power to pressure the government and regulators to pursue those who question him.
    
> We believe the Adani Group has been able to operate a large, flagrant fraud in broad daylight in large part because investors, journalists, citizens and even politicians have been afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal.
    
> We have included 88 questions in the conclusion of our report. If Gautam Adani truly embraces transparency, as he claims, they should be easy questions to answer. We look forward to Adani’s response.

----------------------------

Sharing this article here as I feel it might be of interest to a lot of us who're invested into Adani group companies, either directly or indirectly through index funds. Or have parked extra cash or emergency funds into a debt fund lending to Adani companies. 

I'll share a summary of the report here, while you can read the full report at this link: https://hindenburgresearch.com/adani/

> Today we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the INR 17.8 trillion (U.S. $218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.

> Gautam Adani, Founder and Chairman of the Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly $120 billion, adding over $100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group’s 7 key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819% in that period.

> Our research involved speaking with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of the Adani Group, reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.

> Even if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.
    
> Key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing. 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported ‘current ratios’ below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.
    
> The group’s very top ranks and 8 of 22 key leaders are Adani family members, a dynamic that places control of the group’s financials and key decisions in the hands of a few. A former executive described the Adani Group as “a family business.”
    
> The Adani Group has previously been the focus of 4 major government fraud investigations which have alleged money laundering, theft of taxpayer funds and corruption, totaling an estimated U.S. $17 billion. Adani family members allegedly cooperated to create offshore shell entities in tax-haven jurisdictions like Mauritius, the UAE, and Caribbean Islands, generating forged import/export documentation in an apparent effort to generate fake or illegitimate turnover and to siphon money from the listed companies.
   
> Gautam Adani’s younger brother, Rajesh Adani, was accused by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) of playing a central role in a diamond trading import/export scheme around 2004-2005. The alleged scheme involved the use of offshore shell entities to generate artificial turnover. Rajesh was arrested at least twice over separate allegations of forgery and tax fraud. He was subsequently promoted to serve as Managing Director of Adani Group.
    
> Gautam Adani’s brother-in-law, Samir Vora, was accused by the DRI of being a ringleader of the same diamond trading scam and of repeatedly making false statements to regulators. He was subsequently promoted to Executive Director of the critical Adani Australia division.
    
> Gautam Adani’s elder brother, Vinod Adani, has been described by media as “an elusive figure”. He has regularly been found at the center of the government’s investigations into Adani for his alleged role in managing a network of offshore entities used to facilitate fraud.
    
> Our research, which included downloading and cataloguing the entire Mauritius corporate registry, has uncovered that Vinod Adani, through several close associates, manages a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities.
    
> We have identified 38 Mauritius shell entities controlled by Vinod Adani or close associates. We have identified entities that are also surreptitiously controlled by Vinod Adani in Cyprus, the UAE, Singapore, and several Caribbean Islands.
    
> Many of the Vinod Adani-associated entities have no obvious signs of operations, including no reported employees, no independent addresses or phone numbers and no meaningful online presence. Despite this, they have collectively moved billions of dollars into Indian Adani publicly listed and private entities, often without required disclosure of the related party nature of the deals.
    
> We have also uncovered rudimentary efforts seemingly designed to mask the nature of some of the shell entities. For example, 13 websites were created for Vinod Adani-associated entities; many were suspiciously formed on the same days, featuring only stock photos, naming no actual employees and listing the same set of nonsensical services, such as “consumption abroad” and “commercial presence”.
    
> The Vinod-Adani shells seem to serve several functions, including (1) stock parking / stock manipulation (2) and laundering money through Adani’s private companies onto the listed companies’ balance sheets in order to maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency.
    
> Publicly listed companies in India are subject to rules that require all promoter holdings (known as insider holdings in the U.S.) to be disclosed. Rules also require that listed companies have at least 25% of the float held by non-promoters in order to mitigate manipulation and insider trading. 4 of Adani’s listed companies are on the brink of the delisting threshold due to high promoter ownership.
    
> Our research indicates that offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest “public” (i.e., non-promoter) holders of Adani stock, an issue that would subject the Adani companies to delisting, were Indian securities regulator SEBI’s rules enforced.
    
> Many of the supposed “public” funds exhibit flagrant irregularities such as being (1) Mauritius or offshore-based entities, often shells (2) with beneficial ownership concealed via nominee directors (3) and with little to no diversification, holding portfolios almost exclusively consisting of shares in Adani listed companies.
    
> Right to Information (RTI) requests we filed with SEBI confirm that the offshore funds are the subjects of an ongoing investigation, more than a year-and-a-half after concerns were initially raised by media and members of parliament.
    
> A former trader for Elara, an offshore fund with almost $3 billion in concentrated holdings of Adani shares, including a fund that is ~99% concentrated in shares of Adani, told us that it is obvious that Adani controls the shares. He explained that the funds are intentionally structured to conceal their ultimate beneficial ownership.
    
> Leaked emails show that the CEO of Elara worked on deals with Dharmesh Doshi, a fugitive accountant who worked closely on stock manipulation deals with Ketan Parekh, an infamous Indian market manipulator. The emails indicate that the CEO of Elara worked with Doshi on stock deals after he evaded arrest and was widely known as a fugitive.
    
> Another firm called Monterosa Investment Holdings controls 5 supposedly independent funds that collectively hold over INR 360 billion (U.S. $4.5 billion) in shares of listed Adani companies, according to Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) data and Indian exchange data.
    
> Monterosa’s Chairman and CEO served as director in 3 companies alongside a fugitive diamond merchant who allegedly stole U.S. $1 billion before fleeing India. Vinod Adani’s daughter married the fugitive diamond merchant’s son.
    
> A once-related party entity of Adani invested heavily in one of the Monterosa funds that allocated to Adani Enterprises and Adani Power, according to corporate records, drawing a clear line between the Adani Group and the suspect offshore funds.
    
> Another Cyprus-based entity called New Leaina Investments until June-September 2021 owned over U.S. $420 million in Adani Green Energy shares, comprising ~95% of its portfolio. Parliamentary records show it was (and may still be) a shareholder of other Adani listed entities.
    
> New Leaina is operated by incorporation services firm Amicorp, which has worked extensively to aid Adani in developing its offshore entity network. Amicorp formed at least 7 Adani promoter entities, at least 17 offshore shells and entities associated with Vinod Adani, and at least 3 Mauritius-based offshore shareholders of Adani stock.
    
> Amicorp played a key role in the 1MDB international fraud scandal that resulted in U.S. $4.5 billion being siphoned from Malaysian taxpayers. Amicorp established ‘investment funds’ for the key perpetrators that were “simply a way to wash a client’s money through what looked like a mutual fund”, according to the book Billion Dollar Whale, which reported on the scandal.
    
> ‘Delivery volume’ is a unique daily data point that reports institutional investment flows. Our analysis found that offshore suspected stock parking entities accounted for up to 30%-47% of yearly ‘delivery volume’ in several Adani listed companies, a flagrant irregularity indicating that Adani stocks have likely been subject to ‘wash trading’ or other forms of manipulative trading via the suspect offshore entities.
    
> Evidence of stock manipulation in Adani listed companies shouldn’t come as a surprise. SEBI has investigated and prosecuted more than 70 entities and individuals over the years, including Adani promoters, for pumping Adani Enterprises’ stock.
    
> A 2007 SEBI ruling stated that ""the charges leveled against promoters of Adani that they aided and abetted Ketan Parekh entities in manipulating the scrip of Adani stand proved"". Ketan Parekh is perhaps India’s most notorious stock market manipulator. Adani Group entities originally received bans for their roles, but those were later reduced to fines, a show of government leniency toward the Group that has become a decades-long pattern.
    
> Per the 2007 investigation, 14 Adani private entities transferred shares to entities controlled by Parekh, who then engaged in blatant market manipulation. Adani Group responded to SEBI by arguing that it had dealt with Ketan Parekh to finance the start of its operations at Mundra port, seemingly suggesting that share sales via stock manipulation somehow constitutes a legitimate form of financing.
    
> As part of our investigation, we interviewed an individual who was banned from trading on Indian markets for stock manipulation via Mauritius-based funds. He told us that he knew Ketan Parekh personally, and that little has changed, explaining “all the previous clients are still loyal to Ketan and are still working with Ketan”.
    
> In addition to using offshore capital to park stock, we found numerous examples of offshore shells sending money through onshore private Adani companies onto listed public Adani companies.
    
> The funds then seem to be used to engineer Adani's accounting (whether by bolstering its reported profit or cash flows), cushioning its capital balances in order to make listed entities appear more creditworthy, or simply moved back out to other parts of the Adani empire where capital is needed.
    
> We also identified numerous undisclosed related party transactions by both listed and private companies, seemingly an open and repeated violation of Indian disclosure laws.
    
> In one instance, a Vinod Adani-controlled Mauritius entity with no signs of substantive operations lent INR 11.71 billion (U.S. ~$253 million at that time) to a private Adani entity which did not disclose it as being a related party loan. The private entity subsequently lent funds to listed entities, including INR 9.84 billion (U.S. $138 million at more recent substantially lower exchange rates) to Adani Enterprises.
    
> Another Vinod Adani-controlled Mauritius entity called Emerging Market Investment DMCC lists no employees on LinkedIn, has no substantive online presence, has announced no clients or deals, and is based out of an apartment in the UAE. It lent U.S. $1 billion to an Adani Power subsidiary.
    
> This offshore shell network also seems to be used for earnings manipulation. For example, we detail a series of transactions where assets were transferred from a subsidiary of listed Adani Enterprises to a private Singaporean entity controlled by Vinod Adani, without disclosure of the related party nature of these deals. Once on the books of the private entity, the assets were almost immediately impaired, likely helping the public entity avoid a material write-down and negative impact to net income.
    
> Adani Group’s obvious accounting irregularities and sketchy dealings seem to be enabled by virtually non-existent financial controls. Listed Adani companies have seen sustained turnover in the Chief Financial Officer role. For example, Adani Enterprises has had 5 chief financial officers over the course of 8 years, a key red flag indicating potential accounting issues.
    
> The independent auditor for Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas is a tiny firm called Shah Dhandharia. Shah Dhandharia seems to have no current website. Historical archives of its website show that it had only 4 partners and 11 employees. Records show it pays INR 32,000 (U.S. $435 in 2021) in monthly office rent. The only other listed entity we found that it audits has a market capitalization of about INR 640 million (U.S. $7.8 million).
    
> Shah Dhandharia hardly seems capable of complex audit work. Adani Enterprises alone has 156 subsidiaries and many more joint ventures and affiliates, for example. Further, Adani’s 7 key listed entities collectively have 578 subsidiaries and have engaged in a total of 6,025 separate related-party transactions in fiscal year 2022 alone, per BSE disclosures.
    
> The audit partners at Shah Dhandharia who respectively signed off on Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas’ annual audits were as young as 24 and 23 years old when they began approving the audits. They were essentially fresh out of school, hardly in a position to scrutinize and hold to account the financials of some of the largest companies in the country, run by one of its most powerful individuals.
    
> Gautam Adani has claimed in an interview to “have a very open mind towards criticism…Every criticism gives me an opportunity to improve myself.” Despite these claims, Adani has repeatedly sought to have critical journalists or commentators jailed or silenced through litigation, using his immense power to pressure the government and regulators to pursue those who question him.
    
> We believe the Adani Group has been able to operate a large, flagrant fraud in broad daylight in large part because investors, journalists, citizens and even politicians have been afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal.
    
> We have included 88 questions in the conclusion of our report. If Gautam Adani truly embraces transparency, as he claims, they should be easy questions to answer. We look forward to Adani’s response.

1610192488.0,IndiaInvestments,Correlation between S&P 500 INR and Nifty 50 : -0.35?,"I started this study to find out which one is better between Nifty 50 or S&P 500 (in INR) for LONG term (10yrs). Basically better returns with less risk.  


I got 17 yrs past data and took 10 yr rolling returns. I found out that the average returns comes out to be same and the risk (volatility or standard deviation) is also very similar 🙂  


So now I wanted to know if they go up and down at the same time.. if they don't (if they are not 'correlated'), I can safely put half money in Nifty 50 and half in S&P 500 to make sure that the journey is less bumpy. I did that and I can see negative correlation (-0.35) I was surprised to see this. Am I doing anything wrong? The study is below

1746177381.0,IndiaInvestments,I [23M] have roughly INR 40K to invest per month. I am all ears for good allocation ideas.,"Monthly income - 1 lakh per month  
Emergency fund - None  
EMI/Loan - None  
Responsibilities - None

I'm a little bit financially literate and as for my age I think can go risky. I'd like to make 1 Cr by the time i am 30 if possible.

Here's what i have in my mind so far :

1. 5K - RD -> goal of 2 lakh for emergency fund 
2. 22K - Domestic Equity
   1. **₹8 K** Nifty 50 Index Fund (ICICI, 
   2. **₹6 K** Parag Parikh Flexi Cap 
   3. **₹5 K** Axis Midcap 
   4. **₹3 K** SBI Small Cap 
3. 6K - International Equity
   1. **₹4 K** S&P 500 Index Fund/ETF Motilal Oswal 
   2. **₹2 K** Nasdaq-100 or Global All-Cap ETF
4. 3K - Fixed Income
   1. Public Provident Fund (PPF) SIP – govt-backed
5. 2K - Gold
   1. **Sovereign Gold Bond** tranche
6. 2K - Real Estate
   1. Embassy REIT & Nexus Select REIT

Now i built this plan by talking to friends, relatives, some research on internet and ChatGPT. I have no idea how it will work out.

The underlying indices for these ETFs have been able to beat nifty over 5 and 10 year ranges. Advanced charting tools in the above link can be used to compare these indices.

For comparison last 5 years/ Since Inception if less than 5 years. Used google finance and TickerTape for the numbers-

NIFTYBEES - NIFTY 50 INDEX - 52.37% in last 5 years - 0.27% tracking error **- Baseline**

Kotak NV20 ETF -  NIFTY50 VALUE 20 INDEX - 80.95% from Dec 2015 - 4.08% tracking error **- Beats by 17.36%**

Edelweiss Nifty 100 Quality 30 ETF - NIFTY 100 QUALITY 30 INDEX - 64.14% from Jun 2016 - 2.86% tracking error **- Beats by 11.32%**

ICICI Prudential Alpha Low Vol 30 ETF - NIFTY ALPHA LOW-VOLATILITY 30 INDEX - 3.22% from Aug 2020 - tracking error not available **- Beats by 0.91%**

ICICI Prudential Nifty 100 Low Vol 30 ETF - NIFTY 100 LOW VOLATILITY 30 INDEX - 32.96% from Jul 17 - 4% tracking error **- Beats by 6.23%**

SBI Nifty 200 Quality 30 ETF - NIFTY200 QUALITY 30 INDEX - 12.41% from Dec 18 - 4.34% tracking error **- Beats by 2.33%**

Even the one of best large cap mutual fund in past 5 years have given 75% - 80% returns in last 5 years which the above indexes look to be beating or at-least matching for a much lesser expense ratios. (Most above ETFs have ER < 0.3% according to TickerTape)

&#x200B;

Given this data, isn't it better to move the equity large cap investments to the above ETFs as compared to both active MFs and Index funds/ETFs? Is anyone already investing in these ETFs?

The only downside I see for these ETFs is low volume and higher tracking errors.

1619950086.0,IndiaInvestments,Nifty 50 index Mutual funds,"I'm 23 and this is my first investment, I am interested in passive index funds and would like to invest in nifty 50. After comparing different AUMs, I found the DSP's Nifty 50 to be one of the low costs ones. As of 30 April 21' it's at NAV ₹13.11, and all the other ones are well above NAV ₹25

I want to understand that, why does the NAV of every AUM is different if they are tracking the same index. Is this difference because of the difference in the start date of the fund, as almost all of the have ₹10 as intial price. But then why Nippon's NAV is still 25.61 whereas UTI's NAV is ₹97.64. (2013-01-01)

Correct me, In this scenario, buying DSP's MF at ₹13.11 would provide me more units and therefore I should go ahead with a MF that is low cost among other MFs that track the same index.




TL;DR : Why MFs that track the same index differ in NAV price across different AUM. Would buying the lowest cost MF across different AUM be the best choice.",17,18,"Nifty 50 index Mutual funds I'm 23 and this is my first investment, I am interested in passive index funds and would like to invest in nifty 50.

In this sub I have seen that UTI Nifty Next 50 gets recommended very often. UTI NN50 has a expense ratio of 0.27% where as IDBI Nifty Junior Index has 0.23%. Why UTI NN50 (a recently launched comparision to IDBI NJ) is getting recommended even with higher expense ratio?

Edit: Not linking unemployment rate directly with the markets only considering it as a weak economic prospect.",nifty time high unemployment gdp nifty today time high recently got news unemployment rate years high gdp weak economic data presented big impact markets dont want make post political imagine would happened ruling party get big mandate edit linking unemployment rate directly markets considering weak economic prospect,0.01916666666666667,Hold,1.237310042012109,Buy,13.104647615268805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24800132636209535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13802161420836664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09623453061891613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10159418240123223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24575313293742668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34226102197596653,0.0,0.09723938561964696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12892192582395423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14371976958110852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2801721060456687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14371976958110852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10799041992340233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2188645704697906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10799041992340233,0.0,0.0,0.11154725904321063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16670292015442492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287656646871334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2503284196827009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12892192582395423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18498898803363958,0.0,0.0,0.09205531306173387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45181382593457065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11503846363505026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30651727784121374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913388071289838,0.0,0.0,0.09293957019413766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1. We use [https://www.mfapi.in/](https://www.mfapi.in/) for daily NAV values. It looks like this data goes back only to the start of the 2006-07 FY so we are limited to 14 years of data. 
2. We shortlist eight mutual funds and two index funds using Morningstar’s [fund screener](https://www.morningstar.in/tools/mutual-fund-screener.aspx). The criteria for shortlisting is that they need to have been launched before FY 2006-2007.

We then average out all these CAGRs. Since I don’t have a background in finance, I am not 100% confident that this is the correct way to do it - so please let me know if I’m doing something wrong.

While it does look like mutual funds outperform index funds, there are some caveats   


1. Sometimes, funds wind up and return money to investors when they deliver suboptimal results. I do not know how to obtain data of funds that existed in April 2019 but have closed since then (If anyone is aware of such a data source, please let me know!). Therefore, it is likely that these results exhibit some selection bias. 
2. “Past performance is not indicative of future results”. It could very well be that the conditions that allowed the mutual funds to outperform index funds no longer exist and we cannot expect similar outperformance going forward. Of course, this is entirely subjective.

So this is the 8th Bottom created since January 2018 when NiftySmallcap100 was at 9657. 

Slowly and surely, with every New Bottom, more pain has been evident in Folios of many many investors. 

This particular fall has been baffling for many even the most Technical Chartists. 

Another thing is that during the last 10 years, this fall of 33% has been THE MOST SEVERE barring 2013 (where Smallcap100 fell 35.77%). And to be honest the way things are going, I think this time we are hitting 40%. 

Even an average Investor from 2 years back has seen a decline in their folios this year by 15% to 35%. Even the giants like Maruti and Bajaj Finance have fallen 25% +

###Notes
1. Delta represents change since the last check seven months ago.
2. As an illustration, if a stock has a delta of 25, it means that its weightage has increased by 0.25 since June; delta of -25 represents decreased weightage of 0.25.
3. You may notice some minor errors in delta. Apologies for that.

###Notes
1. Delta represents change since the last check seven months ago.
2. As an illustration, if a stock has a delta of 25, it means that its weightage has increased by 0.25 since June; delta of -25 represents decreased weightage of 0.25.
3. You may notice some minor errors in delta. Apologies for that.

1728536888.0,IndiaInvestments,"I created a python script to notify me of falling market at 1PM based on the rolling returns of last 7 days every day, so that I can place my orders before 2PM and get closing NAV of that day. How good/bad of an idea is this?","Recently watched a video on YT that says investing money in market dips along with the normal SIP significantly boosts returns in the long run.

I got an idea: what if I create a script that notifies me of whenever the fall is happening? But daily fluctuations will be way too much noise, so I decided - the best way to know if there's a dip is to check if the trend is downward for the last 7 days. I also analyzed 7 days rolling returns for every day from 1st Jan 2024 to 9th Oct 2024 and I found at least 1 such occasion every month where all my shortlisted funds (I'm investing in Strategy based Indices coz ig I can afford the risk) were negative. One thing common for all such occasions was the last 7 days rolling for nifty 50 were less than -1.

So my question is:

Is this a good idea for me to deploy my money every time such a dip happens?  I do not have an SIP and I'm not planning to start one either and I have my reasons (unpredictable income in both extremes - extremely high to no income for months). I have been manually investing for months now and I don't see a problem with keeping myself disciplined either. How good of an idea is it to deploy my money based on this strategy?

1527591603.0,IndiaInvestments,Where do you realistically see Nifty in the next 10 years?,"Rakesh Jhunjhunwalla said in 2014 that he expects Nifty to grow by 10-12 times its current level (in 2014) by 2030.

His quote as follows ""Fifteen years ago the Nifty was 850 and today it is 8500. So, the Nifty has progressed 10 times in the last 15 years.

If the outlook for India, which is much better for the next 10 years than the growth in the past 10 years, with increasing investor participation don’t you think next 10 years should not be 10 but 15 times Nifty?

If by sheer earnings, whatever earnings growth we had in the last 15 – I personally believe that the growth that we have had in the value of the Nifty in the last 10 years will be far exceeded in the next 10 years.

In the last 15 years Nifty has grown 10 times, I see no reason why Nifty should not grow 10-12 times in the next 10 years.

I will be disappointed if in 2030 it is less than 125000 – the Nifty. I will give you the basic reasoning. If the earnings grow at 18 percent in 15 years the earnings will grow 15 times.

If there is no expansion in PE the Nifty should be 125000. I think there will be an expansion in PE if this kind of earnings growth takes place. It is mathematics, only the rate of earnings growth is an important matter. So, I will be disappointed if in 2030 the Nifty is below 125000.""



Now I'm not saying Rakesh is a God or anything but he has good knowledge of the market so when he says 10 to 12 times he must be saying it with good reasons.

Even if we assume a conservative 5 times, it still means Nifty around 50k by 2030.

Do you feel this is a realistic possibility?

Also this begs the question, if Rakesh is even somewhere close to correct, doesn't this mean investing in an index fund today can be a great idea like Nifty 50 index fund? Actively managed mutual funds are always a good bet but don't you think that index funds are being very overlooked if Nifty can indeed reach such high levels by 2030?

1694099973.0,IndiaInvestments,ULIP: A personal experience (not a good one) and why one should avoid it,"Hello All,
There are frequent posts about ULIPs. I have personal experience with ULIPs and thought I will document it here. 

My ULIP is with ICICI Prudential for a sum assured of 10L and yearly premium of 1L for 7 years. 5 years of premium payment is mandatory. 

I have paid 5L premium so far, and my account balance is 6,13,000. So, My investment of 1L per year grew at 7% to reach this amount in 5 years. 

**If you look at ICICI Prudential life focus 50 fund NAV, it has an impressive 60% cumulative return (17% annual returns) since Nov 2020. Now, my real returns are 7% but the NAV has returned 17% on average. How can this be? The answer lies below.**

I pay 1L per year, from which about Rs.12,000 is taken by ICICI Prudential as upfront fees and charges (They will take 12k/year for the whole 10 years).  Remaining 88,000 is invested in the focus 50 fund. **Right away, I lose 12% of my investment to fees. Just to make money the market needs to be on a heavy bull run**

Had I invested 1L per year in a nifty 50 fund, say UTI nifty 50 index ETF with a return of 12% every year, I would have a balance of 7,12,000. Clearly, I have lost opportunity to earn 1,00,000 more by choosing ULIP instead of ETF/MF.

The next scummy part of the ULIPs is the insurance part; The fund has highest payout risk in the first year, and least risk in the 7th year. This is how it is skewed towards the insurer.

when  one pays the first year premium of say 1L and dies that year, the company pays out the full benefit 10L, which includes 1L of premium. In effect the company only pays 9L from its pocket. 

second year the real payout from the company's pocket is 8L (10L minus 2L premium paid and gains from the market) and so on. The more premium you pay, the less the company has to pay from their pocket. 

The real insult to this injury is the term insurance premium you would have paid for the same coverage is about Rs. 55,000 for thw whole 10 years. So, you are paying twice as much in ULIP for same coverage (Rs.12k  times 10 year = 120,000) for the coverage plus the investment decisions they make.

**Tax aspect:**

ULIPs are tax free, you get deduction for the investment under 80C and the returns are tax free. However, you can get the same kind of benefits for initial investments from ELSS etc. returns are also tax free upto 1L from ELSS. So, one would have got 12% annual returns for 5 years for the same investments if invested in ELSS instead of ULIP giving 7% real returns. 

TL,DR; 

* **Real life story on how ULIP returned less, comapred to the ""NAV"" that the ULIP companies publish online.** 

* **Hidden fees severely reduce real returns**

* **Term insurance + ELSS is much better than ULIPs**

* **ULIPS are money making machines for the companies and not for the individual**

* **Only case where ULIP makes sense is for people who leave money in their bank accounts and do nothing with it**",275,184,"ULIP: A personal experience (not a good one) and why one should avoid it Hello All,

1607266232.0,IndiaInvestments,A beginner's guide to investing in the stock market (and mutual funds).,"The stock market has witnessed a huge inflow of new investors during this calendar year. The pandemic allowed young people to stay at home with nothing to do. Several have lost their jobs and people have started to realise the importance of investing, and that's always a good thing. Starting off early is a huge advantage for investors.

Although we have [a set of posts for people who are absolutely zero in terms of money management](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/9ltgni/for_someone_who_is_absolutely_at_level_zero_in/), I want to focus specifically on stock market investing. 


There are several things to know about investing in the stock market. Searching on Youtube or Google or Reddit will provide us with an abundance of information. New investors are often confused because of the availability of many different investment products. And, new investors are often indecisive on what to do after starting their investment. I'll do my best to summarise the experiences that I have learned throughout my investment journey, and share all the details that can be helpful for new investors. 

To be a successful investor in the stock market, here are the things that we need to do :


##1. Invest with a proper goal and purpose.

The first step in investing is not to select the best stocks or best mutual funds. It's to identify why you're investing. Find out what you want to achieve by investing. The goal/purpose can be as generic as 'to become wealthy' or 'to save up for retirement'. Or, it can be more specific like 'to buy a home in 10 years', 'to save for my children's education in 20 years' etc. 

Deciding on the goal is crucial, since it allows the investor to think of a proper plan. A goal that's 10 years away will need a different investment strategy than a goal that's 20 years away. If we're saving up for retirement, we'll likely have 20-30 years ahead of us. Knowing the end goal allows the investors to properly decide the amount of money they need to invest. Without a goal or purpose, we'll have a hard time continuing our investment journey.


##2. Invest with consistency and discipline.

An average investor doesn't need any special skills to invest successfully in the stock market. We don't always have to be invested in the *best* mutual funds or the top stocks. We just have to stay invested.

Before choosing a stock or mutual fund for investment, research about it and convince yourself that this is a good investment and that you'll stay invested in it for the long haul. We shouldn't invest in something just because it has performed well recently.

Once you have chosen your investment, invest consistently. Don't stop investing just because the returns in the last couple of years have been bad. Even the best stocks/mutual funds undergo periods of bad performance. 


**Example :** [The Average Investor Lost Money in the Best Performing Mutual Fund in History](https://www.alphawealthfunds.com/2019/08/the-average-investor-lost-money-in-the-best-performing-mutual-fund-in-history/)

Peter Lynch is one of the best investors of all time, and his Magellan fund has an [annualised returns of 29%](https://i.imgur.com/RfrRMvU.png). Even if the fund outperformed the S&P 500, the average investor lost money. Because, the investor will 'buy high and sell low'. That is, whenever the fund isn't performing well, they'll withdraw & whenever the fund performs well, they'll invest money. Instead of investing consistently, they'll look at the past performance of the fund and then invest. So, investing consistently is more important than choosing the best investment.

Even for a consistent investor, they might be forced to withdraw from their investments if there's a sudden need for money. To avoid this, **have a rock-solid emergency fund**. Keep 5% of your net worth in low-risk liquid assets that is unrelated to the stock market. It's good to keep 1 year's expenses as an emergency fund, so that even during worse-case scenarios, you can handle financial emergencies without withdrawing your investments.

##3. Don't stop investing just because there's 'choppy waters' in the market. Don't start investing just because there's optimism in the market.


We should stop investing only when we're close to attaining our goal. When we're years from achieving our goals, we should invest irrespective of the short-term market conditions.

Often, a mutual fund will give nil or negative returns over the span of a few years. It can be extremely discouraging for investors, but that shouldn't a reason to stop investing. Equities don't always perform well. They undergo periods of low performance. That's the time to invest a lot of money, so that when they perform well, we'll reap the rewards for investing in the rough times. The volatility of the stock market can be hard for new investors to grasp. Slowly build up a tolerance to it. Embrace it, and appreciate it. 


**Example :** [Time in the market beats timing the market.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k7cnl9/a_discussion_about_time_in_the_market_vs_timing/). There'll always be some reason to cause turmoil in the market. Even most recently, a lot of people expected the market to crash because of the 2020 US election. But, nothing happened ! In fact, the market rallied even more during and after election. 

[If an investor investing in the S&P 500 index missed out on the 10 best days during the past 15 years, their returns would have been halved !](https://www.putnam.com/literature/pdf/II508-ac37f7ad02b2d8889f7e5361f0e8ac86.pdf). Missing out on the 20 best trading days means that their returns would be ~1/9th of the index's returns. Missing out on the best 30 trading days means that they have lost money.

In the short-term, no one knows what the market is going to do. For a healthy growing economy, the stock market tends to go up in the long-term. For an average investor, [Buy & Hold](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/passive-active-investing.asp) is the best strategy.


## 4. Don't chase after 'returns'. Stick to your plan.

There's always going to an investment that'll give the 'best returns' of a particular year. If we look at a mutual fund and invest in it just because the past 1 year return has been good, we'll be disappointed. No mutual fund or stock (unless it's Asian Paints) perform consistently on a yearly basis. All of them will have periods of low performance.


**Example :** Let's take [PPLTE mutual fund](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/19701/parag-parikh-long-term-equity-fund-direct-plan#fund-performance). It's one of the most favourite mutual fund among investors. When it started in 2014, it gave an annual return of 45%. Any new investor seeing this fund's return would be ecstatic. They'll think ""If i Invest in this, I'll also get such great returns"". They'll invest without any plan or research, and will be utterly disappointed because the returns for the next two years (2015 and 2016) were 9% and 3% respectively. A new investor, who lacks discipline, will stop investing or withdraw because it's a 'bad fund'. BUT, such investors will lose out on the next year's great return which is 30%.



##5. Have faith and optimism in yourself & your investments.

Self-confidence is crucial for investing success. Let's say we buy a luxury house for 2 crores. If someone sees the house and says ""Oh, this house is worth only 1 crore"", would we panic and sell the house for 1 crore ? We wouldn't, right ? We should have the same mentality for our stock market investments.

If we had done enough research, we would know the intrinsic value of our investments. Therefore, we shouldn't sell randomly whenever it's performing badly (temporarily) or if someone criticises it. I'm not saying that we should invest in the same thing throughout out life. I'm saying that we should have faith in our plan. Have faith in the fact that we have analysed and chosen an investment. If the investment tuns out to be bad investment, no problem. Analyse and choose a better investment, and invest with conviction.

Mutual fund investors often have the nagging doubt of whether they have chosen the 'best' mutual fund. For a fund to be the best fund, the fund manager has to do a good job & the market conditions should be good as well. So, the investor has to put their faith in the fund managers and the market. If you find yourself struggling to trust any fund manager to give you consistently good returns, invest in a broad market index fund like Nifty or Sensex. In such a case, you'll just have to put faith in the economy of the country. Even if you don't have faith in the Government, have faith in the county's overall economy. Have the faith that the country will grow, thrive and prosper. Indices like Nifty and S&P 500 are a decent representation of how the county's economy is going. 


Quotes from the book **Learn to Earn : A Beginner's Guide to the Basics of Investing and Business** -

> Before 1930, depressions and panics were a common occurrence, but since the Great One, we haven’t had a single repeat. So in the last fifty years or so, the odds of a slowdown turning into a depression have been quite remote—in fact, they’ve been zero in nine chances. Nobody can be sure you’ll never see a depression in your lifetime, but so far, in the past half-century, you would have gone broke betting on one.


> Is it possible that we’ve found a permanent cure for economic depression, the way we have for polio? There are several reasons to think so. First, the government, through its Federal Reserve Bank system, stands ready to lower interest rates and pump money into the economy any time it begins to look sluggish and to jolt it back into action. Second, we’ve got millions of people on social security and pensions, with money to spend no matter what. Add in the 18 million employees of government at all levels, from federal to local, and you’ve got an army of spenders. As long as this huge group is throwing its money around, the economy can slow, but it can’t come to a complete halt, the way it did in the 1930s. Third, we’ve got deposit insurance at the banks and the savings and loans, so if the banks go bankrupt, people won’t lose all their money. In the 1930s, when hundreds of banks shut their doors, their depositors lost everything. That in itself was enough to drive the country into a catatonic state.


> If you buy the argument that we’re not likely to suffer a relapse into depression, then you can be a little more relaxed about drops in the stock market. **As long as the economy is alive and kicking, companies can make money. If companies are making money, their stocks won’t go to zero. The majority will survive until the next period of prosperity, when stock prices will come back. History doesn’t have to repeat itself. When somebody tells you that it does, remind him or her that we haven’t had a depression in more than a half-century. People who stay out of stocks to avoid a 1929-style tragedy are missing out on all the benefits of owning stocks, and that’s a bigger tragedy.**

Because of fear-mongering news articles, there'll always be a fear of an 'impending market crash' or a recession. An esteemed investor rarely changes his long-term investing strategy no matter what the market does.


##6. Don't chase after shiny new funds/stocks.

[Successful investing is quite boring](https://www.thebalance.com/why-boring-is-almost-always-more-profitable-357440). An average investor is better-off by investing in [index funds](https://i.imgur.com/h433tbs.jpg) and going on with their lives. Even if we invest in stocks directly, always chasing after the 'best' stocks is a recipe for disaster. Yes, there's a miniscule chance that an average investor can invest in a 'multi-bagger'. But, it's nearly impossible to do it consistently.

Some of the consistently-performing stocks are companies that do business in boring sectors. Buying stocks of quality companies (with good financials) will do well in the long-term. Buy stocks of companies that are considered as 'essential' goods, and those stocks will prosper even during recessions.

**Example :** [Domino’s stock outperformed Apple and Amazon over 7 years](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/no-point-1-pizza-chain-dominos-outperformed-amazon-google-and-apple-stocks.html) . For the past decade, Asian Paints has a CAGR of ~25%, and it's stock price has increased tenfold during the decade. Pidilite Industries's stock price has went up by 15 times during the past decade. Neither Asian Paints nor Pidilite Industries is doing anything 'revolutionary' and 'world-changing', like the tech companies. Yet, their stock went up because they produce goods that are essential & they're pioneers in their respective industries.


##7. Keep your emotions in control.

When investing, it's crucial to keep our emotions under control. It's better to avoid having any emotions towards our investments. For instance, let's say that an investor has 20 lakhs invested in a Nifty index fund. Every 1% gain or fall in the Nifty would mean that the investor's money increased or decreased by 20 thousand. Those are not real losses (or gains). They're real only when we sell them.

Let me clarify some of the emotionally-charged doubts that new investors face on a consistent basis :

**Question :** ""The market is at an all-time-high. Should I sell ?!!""

**Answer :** For whatever reasons, new investors are scared of all-time-highs. They somehow think that if a market reaches a new ATH, it means that there'll be a correction. Selling at an all-time-high to 'book profits', for a goal that's several years away, is the most amateurish things an investor can do. Most investors don't even have a plan on what to do with the money after selling. Let the money be invested. No one is gonna steal it.


[If you're not investing in the market to reach all-time-highs, what're you investing for ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k6tj3j/sp_500_nasdaq_dow_30_russell_2000_close_at_all/genawtv/). ATHs are [nothing to be afraid of](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k6tj3j/sp_500_nasdaq_dow_30_russell_2000_close_at_all/gen01sn/).

**Queston :** ""The market is falling everyday.. Should I stop my SIPs?""

**Answer:** This is something that new investors think when they encounter their first bear market. If they started invested during a bull market, they'll suddenly feel scared when the market goes down gradually. 

A falling market is the best time to invest, for a long-term goal. A falling market means that you're buying stocks at a cheaper price. The market isn't going to keep going down forever. Invest more and more during bear markets, so that you'll make more gains during the bull market.

**Question :** ""What is the best time to book profits ?""

**Answer :** Only if you're approaching your goals. Otherwise, **don't redeem your investments for no real reason !** Time in the market is important. Although, some would recommend a tactical rebalancing between equity and debt investments.

**Question :** ""Should I subscribe to this new NFO/IPO ?!""

**Answer :** Avoid it. Let the stock or mutual fund perform for a while, and then decide. There's no need to chase after 'shiny new things'. 

**Question :** ""The market is at an all time high. Is it a good time to start investing ?""

**Answer :** Yes, it is a good time. [Market will be a lot higher 10 years from now](https://i.imgur.com/MheXjxP.jpg). You'd wish that you had started investing right now.

For a real life example, let's assume that an investor started doing an SIP in a Sensex index fund on Jan 2008. It was the peak of the market, right before the market crash. IF the investor continued the monthly SIP till now, the investor's returns would have been ~11%. 

Even if there's a 10% market correction during next month, have the faith that the market will recover gradually. India is a growing economy with a young population. Being the 5th largest economy in the world, we have a LOT of growth ahead of us. An equities investor can reap the benefits of our economic development by investing early and investing consistently.",1532,85,"A beginner's guide to investing in the stock market (and mutual funds). The stock market has witnessed a huge inflow of new investors during this calendar year. The pandemic allowed young people to stay at home with nothing to do. Several have lost their jobs and people have started to realise the importance of investing, and that's always a good thing. Starting off early is a huge advantage for investors.

Although we have [a set of posts for people who are absolutely zero in terms of money management](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/9ltgni/for_someone_who_is_absolutely_at_level_zero_in/), I want to focus specifically on stock market investing. 


There are several things to know about investing in the stock market. Searching on Youtube or Google or Reddit will provide us with an abundance of information. New investors are often confused because of the availability of many different investment products. And, new investors are often indecisive on what to do after starting their investment. I'll do my best to summarise the experiences that I have learned throughout my investment journey, and share all the details that can be helpful for new investors. 

To be a successful investor in the stock market, here are the things that we need to do :


##1. Invest with a proper goal and purpose.

The first step in investing is not to select the best stocks or best mutual funds. It's to identify why you're investing. Find out what you want to achieve by investing. The goal/purpose can be as generic as 'to become wealthy' or 'to save up for retirement'. Or, it can be more specific like 'to buy a home in 10 years', 'to save for my children's education in 20 years' etc. 

Deciding on the goal is crucial, since it allows the investor to think of a proper plan. A goal that's 10 years away will need a different investment strategy than a goal that's 20 years away. If we're saving up for retirement, we'll likely have 20-30 years ahead of us. Knowing the end goal allows the investors to properly decide the amount of money they need to invest. Without a goal or purpose, we'll have a hard time continuing our investment journey.


##2. Invest with consistency and discipline.

An average investor doesn't need any special skills to invest successfully in the stock market. We don't always have to be invested in the *best* mutual funds or the top stocks. We just have to stay invested.

Before choosing a stock or mutual fund for investment, research about it and convince yourself that this is a good investment and that you'll stay invested in it for the long haul. We shouldn't invest in something just because it has performed well recently.

Once you have chosen your investment, invest consistently. Don't stop investing just because the returns in the last couple of years have been bad. Even the best stocks/mutual funds undergo periods of bad performance. 


**Example :** [The Average Investor Lost Money in the Best Performing Mutual Fund in History](https://www.alphawealthfunds.com/2019/08/the-average-investor-lost-money-in-the-best-performing-mutual-fund-in-history/)

Peter Lynch is one of the best investors of all time, and his Magellan fund has an [annualised returns of 29%](https://i.imgur.com/RfrRMvU.png). Even if the fund outperformed the S&P 500, the average investor lost money. Because, the investor will 'buy high and sell low'. That is, whenever the fund isn't performing well, they'll withdraw & whenever the fund performs well, they'll invest money. Instead of investing consistently, they'll look at the past performance of the fund and then invest. So, investing consistently is more important than choosing the best investment.

Even for a consistent investor, they might be forced to withdraw from their investments if there's a sudden need for money. To avoid this, **have a rock-solid emergency fund**. Keep 5% of your net worth in low-risk liquid assets that is unrelated to the stock market. It's good to keep 1 year's expenses as an emergency fund, so that even during worse-case scenarios, you can handle financial emergencies without withdrawing your investments.

##3. Don't stop investing just because there's 'choppy waters' in the market. Don't start investing just because there's optimism in the market.


We should stop investing only when we're close to attaining our goal. When we're years from achieving our goals, we should invest irrespective of the short-term market conditions.

Often, a mutual fund will give nil or negative returns over the span of a few years. It can be extremely discouraging for investors, but that shouldn't a reason to stop investing. Equities don't always perform well. They undergo periods of low performance. That's the time to invest a lot of money, so that when they perform well, we'll reap the rewards for investing in the rough times. The volatility of the stock market can be hard for new investors to grasp. Slowly build up a tolerance to it. Embrace it, and appreciate it. 


**Example :** [Time in the market beats timing the market.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k7cnl9/a_discussion_about_time_in_the_market_vs_timing/). There'll always be some reason to cause turmoil in the market. Even most recently, a lot of people expected the market to crash because of the 2020 US election. But, nothing happened ! In fact, the market rallied even more during and after election. 

[If an investor investing in the S&P 500 index missed out on the 10 best days during the past 15 years, their returns would have been halved !](https://www.putnam.com/literature/pdf/II508-ac37f7ad02b2d8889f7e5361f0e8ac86.pdf). Missing out on the 20 best trading days means that their returns would be ~1/9th of the index's returns. Missing out on the best 30 trading days means that they have lost money.

In the short-term, no one knows what the market is going to do. For a healthy growing economy, the stock market tends to go up in the long-term. For an average investor, [Buy & Hold](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/passive-active-investing.asp) is the best strategy.


## 4. Don't chase after 'returns'. Stick to your plan.

There's always going to an investment that'll give the 'best returns' of a particular year. If we look at a mutual fund and invest in it just because the past 1 year return has been good, we'll be disappointed. No mutual fund or stock (unless it's Asian Paints) perform consistently on a yearly basis. All of them will have periods of low performance.


**Example :** Let's take [PPLTE mutual fund](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/19701/parag-parikh-long-term-equity-fund-direct-plan#fund-performance). It's one of the most favourite mutual fund among investors. When it started in 2014, it gave an annual return of 45%. Any new investor seeing this fund's return would be ecstatic. They'll think ""If i Invest in this, I'll also get such great returns"". They'll invest without any plan or research, and will be utterly disappointed because the returns for the next two years (2015 and 2016) were 9% and 3% respectively. A new investor, who lacks discipline, will stop investing or withdraw because it's a 'bad fund'. BUT, such investors will lose out on the next year's great return which is 30%.



##5. Have faith and optimism in yourself & your investments.

Self-confidence is crucial for investing success. Let's say we buy a luxury house for 2 crores. If someone sees the house and says ""Oh, this house is worth only 1 crore"", would we panic and sell the house for 1 crore ? We wouldn't, right ? We should have the same mentality for our stock market investments.

If we had done enough research, we would know the intrinsic value of our investments. Therefore, we shouldn't sell randomly whenever it's performing badly (temporarily) or if someone criticises it. I'm not saying that we should invest in the same thing throughout out life. I'm saying that we should have faith in our plan. Have faith in the fact that we have analysed and chosen an investment. If the investment tuns out to be bad investment, no problem. Analyse and choose a better investment, and invest with conviction.

Mutual fund investors often have the nagging doubt of whether they have chosen the 'best' mutual fund. For a fund to be the best fund, the fund manager has to do a good job & the market conditions should be good as well. So, the investor has to put their faith in the fund managers and the market. If you find yourself struggling to trust any fund manager to give you consistently good returns, invest in a broad market index fund like Nifty or Sensex. In such a case, you'll just have to put faith in the economy of the country. Even if you don't have faith in the Government, have faith in the county's overall economy. Have the faith that the country will grow, thrive and prosper. Indices like Nifty and S&P 500 are a decent representation of how the county's economy is going. 


Quotes from the book **Learn to Earn : A Beginner's Guide to the Basics of Investing and Business** -

> Before 1930, depressions and panics were a common occurrence, but since the Great One, we haven’t had a single repeat. So in the last fifty years or so, the odds of a slowdown turning into a depression have been quite remote—in fact, they’ve been zero in nine chances. Nobody can be sure you’ll never see a depression in your lifetime, but so far, in the past half-century, you would have gone broke betting on one.


> Is it possible that we’ve found a permanent cure for economic depression, the way we have for polio? There are several reasons to think so. First, the government, through its Federal Reserve Bank system, stands ready to lower interest rates and pump money into the economy any time it begins to look sluggish and to jolt it back into action. Second, we’ve got millions of people on social security and pensions, with money to spend no matter what.

I redeemed all the money I had invested in Birla Sunlife MNC fund, it's a small-midcap fund. I did that because the returns in the last year were pretty bad, almost nil, moreover I think the fund probably has reached its peak.

I now have around 1.5 lakh extra in my bank account and I genuinely don't have any idea what to do with it.

I am 24 years old and just to secure my future I invest 1.5 lakh in PPF every year. At least it'll give me 35 -40 lakh after 15 years for sure.

Other than that I have 15 thousand extra left with me that I can invest. Should I just save all my money and wait for a crash?

For example, BSE website shows MCap FF on [individual stock page](https://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/bajaj-finserv-ltd/bajajfinsv/532978/).",free float market cap data nifty stocks sourced trying find sources consolidated free float market cap data similar request year ago subreddit consolidated source could find example bse website shows mcap ff individual stock page,0.2,Hold,0.6478114659230517,Hold,3.1432467291003423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17313500302333373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20528992517089437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.307207585452926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12990539602176374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2530486375949095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17922779154766363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31479394136926714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43834522345431803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3835380340101079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19477669540814818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17238168369172674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07332836183331096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18382088269828856,0.0,0.0,0.17313500302333373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17507283519906883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10111774708957731,0.10994659914548627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19477669540814818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1980073617442495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12338670275463745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1750572963.0,IndiaInvestments,"How a bank manager sold a legal scam to my friend’s family. SBI Life Smart Platina Plus, broken down.","My friend’s family invested in SBI Life – Smart Platina Plus after a bank manager pitched it as “better than an FD with zero risk.” Here's what they actually signed up for:

₹3L/year for 7 years → ₹21L total investment

2-year lock period

Then ₹2L/year for 15 years (₹30L total)

₹23L maturity payout at the end (year 23)

Total nominal return: ₹53L

What this really means (adjusted for 6% inflation):

₹2L/year payouts lose value over time

₹23L in 2047 ≈ ₹5.9L today

15 annual payouts ≈ ₹15L today


🔹 Total present value: ~₹20.9L
🔹 XIRR: ~5.5–6% annually

There's a ₹33L Term insurance coverage for all this period, bundled with this investment.

A simple mutual fund alternative (SIP):

Same ₹3L/year for 7 years in a Nifty 50 index fund (12% CAGR)

No additional investment after year 7

Value at year 23: ₹1.68 crore

Present value after inflation: ₹43–45L

More than double the real value.

Full liquidity.

No insurance bundling.

You can get ₹1 Cr term insurance = ₹10–12k/year separately.

This SBI Life product gave them 23 years of lock-in, mediocre real returns, and less flexibility; all while being sold as “better than FD.”

Run the numbers. Don’t fall for titles like ""Smart"" or ""Plus.""

NB: This might be common knowledge for many here on r/IndiaInvestments, but I felt it was worth putting out in public for those outside this circle who may not have seen the full picture.


Edit:  Forgot to mention that these agents and bank staff earn up to 30–35% commission on the first-year premium for these policies. That means on a ₹3L payment, they could pocket nearly ₹90,000.
This incentive often explains the aggressive push, misleading comparisons to FDs, and lack of disclosure.",246,31,"How a bank manager sold a legal scam to my friend’s family.

1594237586.0,IndiaInvestments,Understanding nifty next 50 index PE with the bull run,"Hi,

According to the NSE page, the PE ratio for the Next 50 Index was too high till 25th June (Around 90).

But suddenly from 26th June it has plunged to 30.59 and it is still hovering in the 30s.

I don't understand the observation here. The stock prices are rallying, in fact increased since 25th June, but how come the PE ratio reduced so much. Was there any sudden increase in the earnings reported? Even then, how could it make such a big difference?

Thanks.",understanding nifty next index pe bull run hi according nse page pe ratio next index high till th june around suddenly th june plunged still hovering dont understand observation stock prices rallying fact increased since th june come pe ratio reduced much sudden increase earnings reported even could make big difference thanks,0.05142857142857143,Hold,0.7419267551550256,Buy,3.0270094804208694,0.0,0.0,0.11746329772148707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10025805974549364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12166702896547005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14101503104870466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11649207140573102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09694669562037411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14311470570393087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09968222762556303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10394505727898215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09591379409098438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13904268988459118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12056408722507074,0.0916331328857632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13216803052501117,0.13216803052501117,0.0,0.14775105477817635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42934411711179266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10595809096303298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11120473492441334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19285229173589663,0.0,0.05472399602094786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13216803052501117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37565904659239374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12056408722507074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23692882513968908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15320518237854996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337553534032735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12399185099295659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0916331328857632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1033008052275283,0.0,0.07546285026735046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35539323770953357,0.0,0.1337553534032735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15320518237854996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14101503104870466,0.15037438334936207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1732284952.0,IndiaInvestments,"If Indian Equities have higher returns than American equities, why don't all their investors come here to get better returns?","Sorry, if it's a dumb question, but I'm just starting to learn. In the US, almost no actively managed fund has managed to beat Index Funds over a time period of 20-30 years, whose returns have been around 12-14%. In India, the Nifty 50 has given a better return than that over the same time frame and Mutual Funds have given even better than that. Since 1993, Nifty 50 has increased by 2850% whereas S&P 500 has increased by 1320% only. Considering all this, why don't all these American investors invest all their money in India to get better returns? 

I can see 2 reasons: First, the 4-6% difference in inflation between India and US (8% vs 2%). Second, the 3% depreciation of INR vs USD. Please let me know other reasons that might affect other than these. Both of these would mean that a 16% return in India would mean 8% return for US investors, which is lower than what they would get in India and that is why they don't flock here. Is this solid reasoning or am I missing anything? If you can come up with a better calculation for comparing returns between US & India equities, please post it in comments.

So, which is the better equity market, US or India?

1755968874.0,IndiaInvestments,"I picked the ""right stock,” and doubled my money in two years… but my overall returns barely moved. Here’s what I learned about asset allocation.","Back in November 2020, I spent almost a month analyzing ten years of ITC’s financials. Everything about the numbers looked solid, so I finally invested at ₹187 per share.

Fast forward two years later: the price of ITC had shot up to ₹347 per share. That’s an annualized return of 37%! My investment doubled in just two years, outpacing the Nifty 50.

You’d expect me to be thrilled, right? Here’s the twist: my overall portfolio return inched up from 8% to… 9%.

Why? I had invested too little, just 4% of my money into ITC. The rest of my money sat in FDs, RDs, and PF accounts earning \~7–8%. As much as I wanted to high-five myself for the stock pick, it simply didn’t move the needle.

That’s when I had a realization, the real limiter wasn’t my stock-picking skills. It was my asset allocation.

I now think of portfolio design like building a house.

* Decision 1: First you design the blueprint, the number of rooms 

How many asset classes do you need? 

* Decision 2: How big should each room be? 

What is the size (%) of each asset class in your portfolio

* Decision 3: How to furnish each room?  

The stocks, mutual funds and other products in each asset class. 

The lesson I learned was to get the order right. Strategic before Tactical. Blueprint before Furniture. **Asset Allocation before all else.**

How do you balance between “finding winners” and sticking to asset allocation?",111,31,"I picked the ""right stock,” and doubled my money in two years… but my overall returns barely moved.

They have lower expense ratios as well (0.07%, 0.06% vs. 0.11%)

There is a lot of EPF allocation moving to ETFs (probably SBI). Could this be a risk when allocations at the EPF level change?

Reliance is definitely more liquid than the remaining (despite lower AuM), but typically these ETFs allow block exits and entry (for bigger investments, by creating units).

>The Nifty 50 Index closed the day at 10,888, and weekly option volumes for strikes that are closer to the spot level recorded more than 60 percent of the cumulative volumes on that strike, according to data available on Bloomberg. The 10,850 and 10,950 strikes accounted for more than 75 percent of the cumulative volumes, with the monthly options making up the remaining 25 percent.

>The Nifty 50 weekly options, according to a statement by the National Stock Exchange, will have seven consecutive weekly expiry contracts (excluding the week where monthly contracts expire). On expiry of a weekly contract, the exchange shall introduce next weekly contract on rolling basis. The existing three monthly options contracts, three quarterly and eight semi-annual option contracts will also continue to be available. The contracts shall expire on Thursday of every week. In case the Thursday is a trading holiday, the previous trading day shall be the expiry/last trading day. The strike interval for the weekly options will remain the same as monthly contracts.

1540615253.0,IndiaInvestments,Freefincal: Nifty 50 + Nifty Next 50 offers reasonable broad marker coverage at low cost,"In [this article](https://freefincal.com/start-index-investing/), Freefincal outlines that you can approximate the Nifty 100 equal weight with close risk-reward ratios by investing in the Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50 equally. This seems to cover the large and mid-cap space quite well.

&#x200B;

As for options, we seem to have several low-cost index funds. UTI Nifty Fund and UTI Nifty Next 50 Fund seem to provide a good combination, and SBI and ICICI versions of some of these also exist if you want AMC diversification. In the ETF route, SBI Nifty ETF has an expense of around 0.08% (7 bps + GST), while Reliance Nifty BeES is 0.11%. The Next 50 ETFs are also quite low, though liquidity may be an issue.

From the looks of it, we are starting to reach near-Vanguard low-cost levels. With robo advisors using index funds as the core ""beta"" portion in the portfolio, I think we will start to see a gradual increase in AUM of direct index funds.

1552630024.0,IndiaInvestments,Best Nifty & Nifty Junior Index Funds,"I own a lot of Reliance ETF Nifty BEES &  Reliance ETF Junior BEES most of which was bought between 5 to 10 years. Back then these were the best Index funds with low Expense ratios (0.5% & 1.0% respectively then). They also had low tracking errors as compared to the other index funds back then.  

Now, I am selling part of these & rebuying them to take advantage of the first 1 lakh LTCG tax exemption.  

So should buy these same funds again or are there any better Nifty & Next 50 funds which I can buy instead. If yes, why are they better?

1525947473.0,IndiaInvestments,Singapore's Nifty giraffe beats India data ban by a neck,"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/singapores-nifty-giraffe-beats-india-data-ban-by-a-neck/articleshow/63741915.cms

>Singapore Exchange Ltd. has announced a new product that an excited hedge-fund manager described to me as the ""most brilliant use of finance."" That's an exaggeration, of course, though with a large grain of truth.

>SGX will launch three derivative products in June: SGX India futures; SGX India options; and SGX India bank futures. *For 29 out of 30 days, these contracts won't be anchored by any underlying security or index; they will be whatever their buyers and sellers want them to be. However, on the last Thursday of the month, they will get settled according to the average of publicly available expiry prices of futures and options on Nifty 50 (and Bank Nifty) benchmarks on the National Stock Exchange in Mumbai and its offshoot in Gift City in the province of Gujarat.*

>The innovation is subtle, but remarkable. SGX is, in fact, turning the Nifty into a giraffe, which, as economist Hans Singer once famously quipped, is ""difficult to describe, but you know one when you see one."" Throw some Finance 101 into this lesson on bio-linguistics: *If something is unmistakably equivalent to the Nifty index every last Thursday of the month, then it won't become cowrie shells or gold bars on other days without creating a free lunch for arbitrageurs.*

>Why go through all this rigmarole? The backstory is interesting. In February, three Indian equity exchanges came together and banned the use of local securities prices in offshore derivatives. The objective was to kill the newly launched single-stock Indian futures on SGX. The local bourses feared that these offshore derivatives would, like the popular SGX Nifty contract, take trading volumes away from them. Open interest on the gauge is twice as high in Singapore as at home. Vikram Limaye, CEO of NSE, put SGX on a rude, six-month notice: The license under which NSE provided data for the index future to its long-term partner would be scrapped by August, the Indian exchange said.

>A hedge fund in the U.S. can go long or short on the SGX India futures contract; the bank at the other end of the trade will use its access to the onshore Indian market to buy or sell the Nifty to manage its risk. Neither party will have any doubt that what they're actually trading is the SGX Nifty, except it won't be called that. But everyone will know the index when they see the price -- just like everyone knows a giraffe when they see its neck.

Congratulations on hitting the 10K subs mark and acquiring a critical mass... now, where's the partaay?! :)

Okay, time for a quick unsolicited suggestion. Individual stock specific posts are coming up quite frequently these days (sometimes even multiple posts for a single stock). Since you guys are not too keen on (re)introducing flairs, perhaps the current monthly discussion thread could be designated as a stock related news and portfolio discussion thread acting as a catch-all for such posts. The periodicity can be kept unchanged or may even be reduced to a week or fortnight, if so desired. This would help de-clutter things a bit.",3,7,"Singapore's Nifty giraffe beats India data ban by a neck https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/singapores-nifty-giraffe-beats-india-data-ban-by-a-neck/articleshow/63741915.cms

1569319290.0,IndiaInvestments,Intraday trading - history and pros,"Why people use intraday trading.? This is just a waste of time for nse and exchange for scaling (my point of view. But i love making money in a single day and i love intraday trading). Because at the end of the day no demand or supply created by intraday traders(only huge volume).
 (Anyway if the sell option criteria is not satisfied, the shares he brought will be sold at the market closing price). 

So my question is why SEBI(/exchange)  approved intraday trading.? (I dono the complete history too, dont mistake me. Also please share how trading evolves and intraday evolves, before internet came, it's hard to maintain intraday trading.? or how this situation is handled.?) 

Day trading can be traced back to 1867. Soon after the telegraph was invented, stock markets used the telegraph's communication technology to create the first ticker tape.

1551794822.0,IndiaInvestments,[Taxation] How to calculate turnover for intraday option trading?,"Cross posting because couldn't find answer in other sub.

I've earned some income by trading intraday options. I can calculate my profits, subtract expenses from them and pay taxes on the difference according to my tax bracket. This will need audit of my books. Or, I can declare 6% of my turnover as my income(section 44AD) without keeping any books, and pay tax on the amount according to my tax bracket.
Now the question is - how to calculate turnover for option trading? There seems to be lot of ambiguity about it on internet.

It's there on the NSE site, unfortunately the site only allows me to download in year intervals and I want to download atleast 15 years of data, so a site that helps me download in one shot would be super helpful.",tri data nifty largemidcap anyone guide download historical tri data nifty largemidcap since motilal oswal coming fund wanted backtesting data nse site unfortunately site allows download year intervals want download atleast years data site helps download one shot would super helpful,-0.05555555555555556,Hold,0.5082767068871088,Hold,2.0278411963700393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2006527084950565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21110896079156297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6171003434260205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15271157335241234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2553827389527487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21853808968654845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2414366109507849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17882316103453302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21594461958830632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14551742377879964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2553827389527487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14971609960516347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18441996588913906,0.23039941743160935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14289192259023625,0.0,0.15044929181950834,0.148992883104985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1416479431.0,IndiaInvestments,Call for Nifty to 25k !,"Recently I saw a call about nifty reaching the sensex values. The calculations [Source](http://www.wealthforumezine.net/CEOSpeakMotilalOswal030414.html):

**EXAMPLE 1**

GDP today = approx 110 lac crs

GDP growth rate at conservative estimates like last 5 years = 6% real + 7% inflation = 13% nominal growth

GDP after 10 years = 373 lac crs (feel free to alter your assumptions on real, inflation and hence nominal growth and change the GDP number over 10 years)

Last 10 years range of Corporate Profits / GDP ratio = 2.7% to 6%

Current ratio = 4%. Corporate Profits = 4.4 lac crs

Long Term average PE ratio = 16 times

Current Market Cap ~ = 16 times * 4.4 lac crs = 70 lac crs (which is indeed close to current market cap)

10 years hence assuming corporate profit to GDP remains unchanged = 4% = corporate profits = 15 lac crs

Assume PE also remains as per long term average of 16 times, market cap = 239 lac crs

With market cap at 70 lac crs today Nifty = 6500. So if market cap goes to 239 lac crs, what will Nifty be???? = 22064!!!!!!!!!

You now need to calculate the Nifty if the following extremes are tested in the market which are always tested depending on whether we are in bull or bear market

1) What if GDP growth is 9% real GDP growth instead of 6% GDP growth?

2) What if corporate profits to GDP ratio is 6% instead of 4%?

3) What is market PE is 24 times as in past peak instead of current 16 times average?

You will find that Nifty will be = to today's Sensex in worst case. In the best case???

**EXAMPLE 2**

There is an alternate logic to this as well. In the peak of 2008 the GDP was Rs 45 lac crs and the market cap of India was Rs 75 lac crs. Today the GDP is 110 lac crs but market is still 75 lac crs.

Historically the range of market cap to GDP ratio has been between 0.5 to 1.75 times.

Over the next 5 years at say 13% nominal growth rate take above the GDP should be Rs 202 lac crs. In this period if the market cap to GDP ratio is 0.5 you will get 6% return on equity, if market cap to GDP ratio is 1 time you will get 22% return on equity and if you are in an equity party where market cap to GDP gets to its peak of 1.75 times, you will get 36.5% return on your equity investment.

Should an investor be in any asset class other than equity? And what should be one's % allocation to equity? What is it now?

1542017666.0,IndiaInvestments,Where can I download the weighted list of tickers for NIFTY broad market indices?,"Specifically, NIFTY500 for now.

&#x200B;

I can get list of stocks from NIFTY website. Value Research and Money Control have partial/full named list with market cap (which I assume is proportion to weight if I normalize the sum to 100%). But I want to have IN\* tickers along with weights. Since names are spelled and abbreviated differently matching with tickers is huge manual work.

&#x200B;

Why I want them?

Just want to compare my MF holding to broad market to see if my collective holdings across funds, weighted by my portfolio exposure in fund, are mimicing broad market or not. I DO NOT want them to mimic but maybe I am inadvertently. Portfolio overlap tool doesn't do this. If there is direct tool to do that, that will be good too.",7,3,"Where can I download the weighted list of tickers for NIFTY broad market indices? Specifically, NIFTY500 for now.

1735705553.0,IndiaInvestments,"Planning to retire in 17 years at age 50, should I sip only in 1 fund?","I am planning to invest 1 lac per month from today for next 17 years as I don't want to work beyond 50. I did use some calculators and for the corpus that I need for daily expense after 17 years, I need to start sip of around 88k. I am planning for 1L round figure.

I have emergency fund for next 6 months and good enough savings right now but I don't own a house and might buy later   so might have some huge liability in future but still I don't plan to bother my 1 lac per month retirement fund even if I need to pay emi as I can take help from wife.

Now the question in my mind is, should I just choose 1 fund to get more benefit or get 3-4 seperate funds and balance out (in this case returns will be less since amount will be divided)

I am not expecting any ROI greater than 12 and also don't have any exact corpus figure in my mind...I guess 6-7 CR would be enough for daily expense up until age of 70",108,72,"Planning to retire in 17 years at age 50, should I sip only in 1 fund?

1753726137.0,StockMarket,Released My First TradingView Script: Frozen Daily 5 Day EMA (Stays Fixed Intraday),"Hi everybody:

I could not find a single indicator that froze the 5 day EMA based on the daily timeframe so I released my first script on tradingview.

[Enclosed is a chart of today's intraday action on Netflix and how it reacted to the 5 Day EMA. It initially held it but as it had not been tested in nearly 10 days, it failed.](https://preview.redd.it/vday3ik7pnff1.png?width=3050&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97319797da990a5637418a1a3cadcc83a880344)

[https://www.tradingview.com/script/TXy7gMyu-Moving-Average-Exponential-Daily-Frozen-EMA/](https://www.tradingview.com/script/TXy7gMyu-Moving-Average-Exponential-Daily-Frozen-EMA/)

This script plots an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) based on the daily timeframe.

The EMA value is frozen for the entire current daily session, only updating when a new daily candle begins.

How it works:  
The EMA is calculated using the 1-day timeframe, regardless of the chart's current timeframe.

This EMA value remains fixed throughout the day as it doesn't fluctuate intrabar.

It updates only once the daily candle has closed, providing a stable and reliable reference point during the trading day.

The default is the 5 day EMA but can be changed to any EMA timeframe you desire such as 9, 21, 50, 100. 200, etc.

Hope this helps, happy trading!",4,0,"Released My First TradingView Script: Frozen Daily 5 Day EMA (Stays Fixed Intraday) Hi everybody:

1753994906.0,StockMarket,"Figma stock soars 230% in first day of trading, valuing company north of $40,000,000,000","After [opening for trade just before 2:00 p.m. ET on Thursday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figma-stock-soars-230-in-first-day-of-trading-valuing-company-north-of-40-billion-132215034.html) at $85 per share, Figma ([FIG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FIG)) was trading above $109 with about 30 minutes to go in Thursday's trading session, rising more than 230% from where the design and collaboration software firm priced its [initial public offering at $33](https://www.figma.com/blog/ipo-pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) per share.

At the opening of trading on Thursday, the company was worth more than $45 billion. Shares were halted for trade within moments due to volatility.

The company's IPO process, including both where it priced the debut and how shares traded at the open, showed demand remains strong for new issues; Figma priced its IPO above [expectations for a range of $30-$32](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025036090/figmas-1a2.htm). The company raised roughly $1.2 billion in a [sale of 36.94 million shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025036090/figmas-1a2.htm), split between the company's sale of 12.47 million shares and existing shareholders' sale of 24.46 million shares.

Figma, helmed by CEO Dylan Field, is set to be the latest indicator of an IPO market that has been strong in 2025, with tech darlings like Circle ([CRCL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRCL)) and CoreWeave ([CRWV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWV)) seeing [shares soar after public debuts earlier this year](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ipo-market-in-2025-is-being-driven-by-a-clear-theme--bigger-is-better-100026880.html).",424,176,"Figma stock soars 230% in first day of trading, valuing company north of $40,000,000,000 After [opening for trade just before 2:00 p.m. ET on Thursday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figma-stock-soars-230-in-first-day-of-trading-valuing-company-north-of-40-billion-132215034.html) at $85 per share, Figma ([FIG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FIG)) was trading above $109 with about 30 minutes to go in Thursday's trading session, rising more than 230% from where the design and collaboration software firm priced its [initial public offering at $33](https://www.figma.com/blog/ipo-pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) per share.

The dip in price can be an opportunity for tomorrow morning as long as the price does not gap up overnight, if it does then I'll watch the direction the price and volume moves and if it goes down it might be a good entry point for an intraday trade. Of course the fear is that a correction is under way at worst it seems an intraday buy on an opening price drift down might turn into a swing trade for the following reasons.

1. For the last 50 days the stock price has outperformed as it is now above its 50 day average price.

1697495057.0,StockMarket,"Does majority rule for intraday price movements? (QQQ / SPY, money flowing in favor of increase & decrease)","Daytrading QQQ and SPY based on majority rules tactic.

Does majority opinion rule for intra-day trading?

Little bit of an opinion piece here.

I like to web scrape. I’ve been scraping trades placed on Kalshi throughout the day, which is an event-based trading platform.

I’m focusing on two events: where the NASDAQ will close and where the SPY will close for the current trading day.

By tracking money placed in favor of price increases and money placed in favor of price deceases - I’d like to trade with the majority.

This is an elementary train of thought - stemming from my days playing kahoot in elementary school.

No matter the question (ie it could have been as random as our teacher’s summer vacation), the majority opinion of the class was almost always correct.

I know that Kalshi is limited in the opinions it’s collecting, but how do people feel about this - especially if it had 100x the traffic/scope?

Is the money flowing in favor and against SPY and QQQ a result of the past price changes, or are people viewing said change and voting on where they think the stock will head next?",11,11,"Does majority rule for intraday price movements?

Here are the results.,"**Preamble:** Michael Burry is definitely a controversial figure. He rose to fame betting against the subprime mortgage market and making a 489% return for his investors between Nov’00 and Jun’08 (SP500 returned just 3% in the same period).

But, I recently observed that in every news article/tweet, he always talks about an impending crash. As recently as last week, he issued another warning stating that there would a “mother of all crashes soon due to the meme-stock and crypto rally that will approach the size of countries”. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether Michael Burry always predicts a crash and gets lucky when there is an actual crash or does his prediction actually turns out to be true most of the time?**

**Analysis**

The various news articles spanning over the last 15 years were obtained from Google News \[1\]. I flagged the date of each crash prediction and then analyzed the performance of the market/stock over the

a. Next 1 Month

b. Next 1 Quarter

c. Till Date

I will not be including the subprime mortgage crash prediction in this analysis as we all know how that turned out and how that made him famous. Also, there are no news reports covering Burry before that.

The performance figures are calculated based on the prediction. If Burry specifies a stock, then I am using that particular stock as the benchmark. If its broader prediction relating to the overall market, then the benchmark used is S&P 500.

There was a long gap of 9 years after the 2008 crash where Burry stayed out of the public view and did not make any warnings or predictions about the market.

His first verifiable prediction after the 2008 crisis [came in May 2017](https://www.lombardiletter.com/michael-burry-stock-market-crash/10895/) where he warned that we can expect a global financial meltdown and World War 3. In his exact words

>I didn’t go out looking for this, I just did the math. Every bit of my logic is telling me the global financial system is going to collapse

But it’s been 4 years since the prediction and the market is chugging along just fine. S&P500 has returned a respectable 93% to date and there is [no imminent threat](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/timeline/) of a World War happening.

Burry’s next prediction was in [Sep 2019](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-big-short-s-michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos-1.1310874) where he said that index funds are the next market bubble and are comparable to subprime CDOs. He said that index fund inflows are now distorting prices for stocks and bonds in the same way that CDO purchases did for subprime mortgages more than a decade ago. He said the flows will reverse at some point, and “it will be ugly” when they do.

This prediction also did not pan out as S&P500 has returned 50% to date over the last two years and the only crash that occurred during this period was the Covid-19 flash crash from which the market made a sudden recovery.

Burry’s next target was on Tesla where he said that Tesla’s stock price is [ridiculous](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-reveals-hes-short-tesla-tells-elon-musk-to-issue-more-stock-at-its-ridiculous-price/articleshow/79538731.cms) and that it would [collapse](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-predicts-tesla-stock-will-collapse-like-the-housing-bubble-enjoy-it-while-it-lasts/articleshow/80171258.cms) like the housing stock bubble. I have kept both the articles there which had only one month difference as we don’t know exactly when he shorted the stock. The returns would be substantially different if he did it in Dec’20 when compared to Jan’21 as Tesla had a phenomenal run in December.

He [reiterated](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-the-stock-market-is-dancing-on-a-knifes-edge-and-fears-hes-being-ignored-again/articleshow/81154288.cms) again on Feb’21 that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge and he is being ignored again. He felt the boom in day traders due to the meme stock mania and the increasing cash flow to the index trackers would cause a massive bubble. This prediction also hasn’t turned out to be right as the market has returned 11% to date over the last 4 months.

Burry’s only prediction that we can say confidently was right after the 2008 mortgage crisis is that he called [Bitcoin a speculative bubble](https://moguldom.com/340499/michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-mortgage-crash-says-bitcoin-is-a-speculative-bubble-sends-prices-lower/) in March’21. Bitcoin has since dropped 28% in around 3 months. Even in this case, we don’t have enough data to showcase how this prediction would turn out over the next one/two years.

Burry was most active in 2021 making the most number of predictions with the latest in Jun’21 stating that we are currently in the [greatest speculative bubble of all time](https://moguldom.com/358632/investor-michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-subprime-mortgage-crisis-says-this-is-greatest-speculative-bubble-of-all-time-in-all-things/). Only time will tell how this one will turn out!

**Conclusion**

I have immense respect for Michael Burry and his skills. He was a doctor and worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then left to start his own hedge fund that became [extremely successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry). But, as you can see from the above analysis, he is more often wrong than right with his predictions \[2\].

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[3\]. Out of the 100 predictions you make, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high.

The key point here is that if you believe in Michael Burry, you will have to follow all of his recommendations \[4\] and not pick and choose what you feel comfortable with as most of the returns would be from an extremely unlikely scenario.

He [reiterated](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-the-stock-market-is-dancing-on-a-knifes-edge-and-fears-hes-being-ignored-again/articleshow/81154288.cms) again on Feb’21 that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge and he is being ignored again. He felt the boom in day traders due to the meme stock mania and the increasing cash flow to the index trackers would cause a massive bubble. This prediction also hasn’t turned out to be right as the market has returned 11% to date over the last 4 months.

Burry’s only prediction that we can say confidently was right after the 2008 mortgage crisis is that he called [Bitcoin a speculative bubble](https://moguldom.com/340499/michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-mortgage-crash-says-bitcoin-is-a-speculative-bubble-sends-prices-lower/) in March’21. Bitcoin has since dropped 28% in around 3 months. Even in this case, we don’t have enough data to showcase how this prediction would turn out over the next one/two years.

Burry was most active in 2021 making the most number of predictions with the latest in Jun’21 stating that we are currently in the [greatest speculative bubble of all time](https://moguldom.com/358632/investor-michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-subprime-mortgage-crisis-says-this-is-greatest-speculative-bubble-of-all-time-in-all-things/). Only time will tell how this one will turn out!

**Conclusion**

I have immense respect for Michael Burry and his skills. He was a doctor and worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then left to start his own hedge fund that became [extremely successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry). But, as you can see from the above analysis, he is more often wrong than right with his predictions \[2\].

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[3\]. Out of the 100 predictions you make, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high.

The key point here is that if you believe in Michael Burry, you will have to follow all of his recommendations \[4\] and not pick and choose what you feel comfortable with as most of the returns would be from an extremely unlikely scenario.

\[1\] Google News has a [nifty feature](https://researchbuzz.me/2019/07/22/if-youre-not-using-more-of-google-news-date-options-you-might-be-missing-out/#:~:text=As%20you%20probably%20know%2C%20Google,hours%2C%20and%20the%20past%20hour.) where they allow you to search news in specific time periods. Also, Google News seems to capture almost all the major publications other than the historical archives.

\[2\] The current analysis is done using all the publicly available records. We are not considering the personal bets he made, conversations he had with his friends/family/investors, etc. This can definitely alter the

\[3\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).

\[4\] At that point, if you are that confident in his predictions, you can [invest in his hedge fund](https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/scion-asset-management-review). Please note that you need to have a minimum capital requirement ($1 million minimum investment and some extra regulatory requirements)

1694198985.0,StockMarket,"Exit Strategy for Options Selling, Intraday!?","Hello Fam, Greetings

I am eager to learn from you, different perspectives on EXIT STRATEGY for Options Selling ( non-directional, short straddle, intraday)

1. Should I keep a profit TARGET limit order and exit once it hits OR...
2. Should I wait till the end of day i.e.2:55pm or 3:15pm, so to not lose any beneficiary market momentum at the last hour, even if i have a possibility of exiting with a 50% profit much earlier.
3. Have a TARGET in mind (but not a target limit order set) and exit once I earn that or can continue till EOD as needed based on then market conditions, on a daily basis.

Which is best, based on your experiences.

I want to keep a principle of following any one of the above and stick to it, but confused.

Though profits are important, I don't want to risk my capital.

I. Summary: Today's Nasdaq is more difficult to do, mainly for two reasons: first of all, the opening position in the oscillation zone, followed by the distance from the upper and lower edges are relatively far, the profit and loss ratio is very low, so it is divided into the following two cases:

1. yesterday at the high level of 12800 above the hit SQQQ, and leave a position, then do not need to move today, but 12900 will not stop loss.

2. yesterday did not hit the high SQQQ (such as I hahaha, fell asleep), then the opening of today's attention to the two positions:

12754: This position is a small watershed, above a small position to see more, below a small position to see short, because today's opening position is about 12754 below, then it is best to open within 30 minutes out of a shock trend, and then choose the direction after going in, a little more secure, regardless of how short \~

12582: this position rebound, it is the day short take profit level, swing short can be ignored; this position fell below, the day and swing short can consider adding a little position, and the day short position can be turned into swing short position.",0,0,"[2023.03.24 US Intraday, Swing Trading - Pre-Market Strategy Analysis] Nasdaq Reference Underlying: $Nasdaq 100 Index (.NDX.US)$$Nasdaq 100 Index MasterLink (2306)([NQmain.US](https://NQmain.US))$$Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC.US)$$

1720661509.0,StockMarket,Nike is a bargain right now ,"Right now, these prices are an absolute fire sale. Maybe I missed the part where people are going to stop buying nike worldwide. Apparely Nike has less going for it than it did in 2018! I mean just look at this chart below that covers 10 years:

https://preview.redd.it/iu6j7po4esbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c1f26a35134503bac803a0e66745e0570dd984

You have a volume read of 129,996,982 on June 28th. Right now the markets are highly infactuated with tech stocks and things like TSLA or PLTR. Something boring like Nike is far from the excitement anyone is looking for as new ATH's are being made every day on QQQ or SPY. Theres nothing sexy about it at all. 

This is where the best prices can be obtained. No one wants the stock. So few people  want the stock that they are willing to actually sell it at prices first seen May 25th 2018. Even in 2020 with a full blown pandemic breaking out with unknown consequences only saw Nike hang out below this price for a whopping 7 trading days. Lil trip down and V shape recovery. 

Even from a pure volume only perspective the following shows some interesting things: 

https://preview.redd.it/1bzv8typfsbd1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1d49c9ce85029ead6b011b9f6e80c6212a4aedc

The lowest volume day is about 15.95M for any day since the big drop. The volume on the day of the big drop is unprecedented. The 2nd highest volume day in the last decade was 12/23/2015. Hilariously almost around the same price! The high of that day back then was 68.20 and was a new all time high. 

The difference with large volume down here is its the opposite. Large amounts of demand are showing up down here. In the past the big volume was correlated with being near big highs. But Nike wasnt even near its high right before it dropped either. 

So what I would say is that finding a bottom is a matter of flushing people out. You gotta get to that point where even the most committed person who would have a 1% chance of selling pre earnings is now ready to and currently selling. Thats probably going on and we couldn't sport such volume down here if there wasn't some equal demand. The price has not moved much. You have a high there of 79.05 and we are down to about 72 now. 

Lets just look at the actual income here: 

https://preview.redd.it/xzur7vt5hsbd1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af40a030a7bcd30e707eced540bcd4b524d0718

Over the last 10 years, the revenue is only going up. Even if the company is faltering so to speak, these prices are far from connected to the reality of actual income. 

Check out the P/E below

Even right here you can see that right now Nike is sporting a P/E that looks to be just over 20. But its actually even lower and this chart is delayed: 

[https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/stocks\/charts\/NKE\/nike\/pe-ratio](https://preview.redd.it/clkllnaqhsbd1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=1086c990d16ec783406e0232352d91dd436b1460)

The last time the P/E was under 18.30 was Nov of 2011...

  
Now heres what I do know. Alot of fund managers are going to be looking at these beautiful pictures over the coming weeks/months:

https://preview.redd.it/k89wawq9isbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=584b84419187792d995cf8564dd1b2a8b2634a30

https://preview.redd.it/rt6lldodisbd1.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=8be01e03ad07e2755ad782bb82ba9ede8386eaf3

They are going to potentially sell some of those wildly running high stocks. Then they will be sitting on some cash they need to find another play for. All of a sudden, seemingly out of nowhere on your favorite stock channel, all the analysts will be upgrading nike. Show hosts and guests will be talking about how the stock is too cheap and all that fun fancy stuff they do AFTER they bought the ol dippity skippity. They are going to have to do something with the money. They will see Nike. I doubt  they will just pass it up. 

Since  the fed hasnt cut rates yet, theres nothing to really worry about. Even when that happens markets should run a good 3-5% further before they tap out from whatever caused the fed to cut in the first place. 

Now lastly, what brought me to this trade idea at all? Adobe. How did Adobe lead you to see something in Nike? I remember 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/oj4sxjz7ksbd1.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=1865e6cf78f673a4d37ae4b46ff9aeb0e85f2271

In 2022, there was a big gap down and this brought Adobe to prices not 1st achieved since Sept of 2018. I passed this one up. I let the fear keep me out of the trade. Surely everyone who was selling was correct. Obviously thats the crowd that always wins. 

Since we are dealing with panic, lets get up close and examine how the panic works: 

https://preview.redd.it/xrmmklaxksbd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=7998168ec3829f129b26d6c91fabde81a34a86d5

The day of panic was mid Sept and a bottom was put in over the  next two weeks. It did however fight against going higher. You can see that in those micro higher lows leading into mid Nov where it said goodbye to those lows permenantly. So quite clearly any attempts to make the stock run in the near term should be expected to be stamped out. Espeically if we see a run back up to 78. It will probably have to retest its low whatever it is a couple of times over the coming months. 

Quite clearly those retests whenever they happen SHOULD end higher on that day as they did with adobe there. That would be a sign of people buying the dip 10/10. 

It won't happen overnight, but I do think the stock could fill its gap within the next 3-4 months. Even if things get ""bad"" around the election period, Nike already got the business. 

TLDR; Everyone hates Nike so you should love it long time. Thats all you really need to know. ",105,186,"Nike is a bargain right now  Right now, these prices are an absolute fire sale.

During the podcasts they spoke about an event that happend when your intraday change is greater than the price that you paid for that stock. I forgot about the term but I believed it was something close to an ""iffy"" or something.   


I'm asking because today the Intellia Therepeutics stock jumped 50% which is +$44.60 in a single day. I bought my shares at $13,16 so today is clearly that event happening for me.

1752055985.0,StockMarket,Trump's Trade War Letters: Here’s What’s Confirmed + 3 Possible Market Outcomes,"Hey everyone,

I’ve put together a summary of **what’s been confirmed so far** on the Trump administration’s pending tariff announcements, along with **three plausible paths** for how this could unfold in the global economy.

All information is accurate as of **Wednesday, July 9th, 2025 (\~5:30 AM ET)**.

# Verified Developments

1. **Two-Wave Tariff Letters Today (Wednesday):** Trump confirmed via Truth Social that letters involving **at least 7 countries** would be released in the **morning**, and more in the **afternoon**. [Truth Social Post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114820176419744768)
2. **EU Identified as Primary Offender:** In a cabinet meeting, he stated the **EU is ""worse than China""** and that a letter to them could be expected within two days i.e. **by Thursday**. (check the White House YT Channel and yesterday's meeting between 42:20 - 44:50; not allowed to paste YT links)
3. **New Tariff Regime Introduced:**
   * Countries with minor deficits: **25–35% tariffs**
   * Countries with “massive deficits”: **60–70% tariffs** (check the White House YT Channel and yesterday's meeting between 42:20 - 44:50; not allowed to paste YT links)

# 3 Possible Market Paths

**1. The Literal Application (Market Shock):**  
Massive tariffs on countries like Mexico and the EU based on trade data, as they have massive deficits. This will lead to global supply chain disruption and a risk-off shock across equity and currency markets.

* 60–70% on major players.
* **Sell-off in exporters, industrials, autos**
* USD rallies, EM currencies get hit.
* Volatility (VIX) spikes.

**2. The Strategic Retreat:**  
Tariffs are applied unevenly, where it's high for smaller nations, lower for the EU following backchannel diplomacy, leading to market tensions but not a full-scale retaliation.

* High tariff on 1 - 2 smaller countries
* EU gets 25 - 35%; markets bounce slightly
* Partial de-escalation narrative helps stabilize things

**3. The Wild Card:**  
Erratic or delayed application of tariff rules, but will result in the highest uncertainty. Markets face information asymmetry and react with persistent volatility.

* Some letters come, others delayed
* Mixed tariffs with no clear logic
* Markets stay jumpy all week; direction unclear

# What to Watch

* **EU Letter:** If it hits Thursday with a high number, expect heavy market reaction
* **Sectors:** Multinationals, autos, semis at risk
* **Safe havens:** Gold and Treasuries could rally
* **Futures Action:** Big intraday moves likely as headlines drop



**Long volatility seems to be the play considering the low VIX levels.**",90,54,"Trump's Trade War Letters: Here’s What’s Confirmed + 3 Possible Market Outcomes Hey everyone,

**Conclusion for today’s Zynga Inc Intraday analysis:** Bullish momentum is expected to continue with a minimum price target of 6.65.

An intraday timeframe (6 hour) candlestick chart of Zynga Inc. is presented in today’s analysis

The uptrending action in price since November 2018 is highlighted with the use of a bullish trendline. The 50 moving average and 200 moving average (MA) are also used for the purpose of following the current bullish trend.

Zynga (ZNGA) reached a price peak of 6.62 on August 1, 2019 that was followed immediately by a sell off. The ensuing selloff after the August 1 peak did close below the 200 MA, which implies a bearish bias.

[Zynga Inc.: 6 Hour Timeframe Chart Analysis](https://i0.wp.com/coinanalyst.investments/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zynga_stock.png?ssl=1)

However, the trendline as drawn indicates the selloff consolidating and successfully testing the long term trendline. Evidence of a successful test at support (long term trendline) includes bottoming price action (i.e. consolidation) and lack of continuation of downside market action.

Also worthy of note is the formation of what is rather known as a rectangle bottom chart pattern (not shown here) at the long term trendline that lasted between August 16, 2019 and September 13, 2019 that saw price action break out of the pattern to the upside.

Zynga close the day at 6.04 which on the 6 hour timeframe is trading right under its 200 moving average. Continuation after breakout from the rectangle bottom chart pattern (ideally bearish) would require Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) to trade and also close above its 6 hour timeframe 200 moving average.

5.51 and 5.66 provide a support zone for price which also coincides with its long term trendline. Lack of a break above the 200 moving average could see price return to the aforementioned support zone. A break below 5.51 implies resumption of bearish momentum and further lower prices to be anticipated.

The minimum target for the current bullish analysis for Zynga is 6.96 with 7.35 and even 8.49 representing higher price targets or levels.",3,0,"Zynga Stock Price: Intraday Analysis and Bullish Bias….

1543420247.0,StockMarket,1 Stock - 1 Trade OR Multiple Stocks - Multiple Trades in Intraday Trading?,"I am trading intraday for 1.5 months, So I am new to trading and I need help understanding something. Today I performed tens of trades and made about 650 (450 after taxes) but while I was analyzing stocks aftermarket for next day, I found something interesting.

As I said, I made tens of trades to make some 450 amount. But I found some (Actually, A lot of them) stocks that could make 2.5k to 4.5k in a single day with the same margin if I had made a single trade with all the amount I have in a single stock. And I am thinking to avoid multiple trades so that I do not have to invest too much time constantly looking at the screen as I have one business to manage.

So, I want to start trading only 1 stock a day. 1 stock and 1 trade in a single day. Maybe I can do something like 3 stocks and 3 trades in a day to avoid risking all the money as trades might go wrong and I might lose some (a good amount) money.

**I want help** when it comes to trusting candlestick patterns in intraday trading if I am considering only 1-2 trades a day. **And I also want to know** what things I have to keep in mind to change my trading style. By changing the way of trading from multiple trades to single and huge trades in a day, I can maximize my profit at least by 5x.

**NVIDIA (NVDA) is expected to find support between 171.12 and 167.32 before price resumes current uptrend from 130.73.**

 Two of the major benefits of using the Elliott wave principle amongst others are the following:  
• It helps us provide context for price action  
• Provides point(s) of invalidation for using it in chart analysis. 

 Price action successfully held at the upper boundary of support (128.47) between 21 December 2018 and January 03, 2019, and is part of the basing process for price action since November 19, 2018.

Use of Wave analysis for today therefore focuses only on the most recent bullish price swing from January 04, 2019 to current date. Minuette wave (i) commenced at 130.73, followed by Minuette wave (ii), with Minuette wave (iii) identified as the most recent wave that has just terminated.

This (wave iii) did finish only a few points away from the top boundary (194.59) of overhead resistance mentioned in the previous analysis. Minuette wave iv is thus currently underway, and is anticipated to terminate in the region of the subminuette wave iv of Minuette wave (iii) i.e. 4th wave of one lesser degree.

This region coincides with support as indicated on the 6 hour timeframe chart between 171.12 and 167.32 where Minuette wave (iv) would have retraced \~38.2% of Minuette wave (iii).

Minuette wave (v) is therefore expected to resume upon termination of wave (iv). i.e. this implies higher prices in NVIDIA. Point of invalidation for this analysis is wave (iv) overlapping wave (ii), which means price should not continue to sell off and close below 134.71.",1,0,"NVDA (NVIDIA) Stock Analysis: Intraday Timeframe **Conclusion for today’s NVDA stock analysis:**

1526995526.0,StockMarket,Brokerage / Data provider with Intraday Historical Data for Foreign Equities,"Hi guys,

I’m looking for a brokerage or data provider with intraday historical data (5-10 years) for European and/Or Japanese equities. Sadly, quandl and all the other data go-Tos either provide only EOD data or not enough historical data. Ditto the brokerages. Specialty data outfits like Tick Data are prohibitively expensive. Is there any solution that I’m overlooking?

I do understand the logic behind the initial technical rebound. After the U.S. president triggered a risk-off wave by announcing actual or potential tariffs on Chinese and European goods, many indexes corrected sharply. That move made sense, especially given how fast sentiment can shift when geopolitics and trade barriers resurface.

But what’s happened since then looks more like a short squeeze or a programmatic “buy the dip” cascade. EWG, for example, has rebounded aggressively from its April lows ; not just recovering lost ground, but pushing toward year-to-date highs. EWI shows a similar pattern. This is happening despite a weak eurozone macro backdrop, uncertain inflation dynamics, political instability in France, and the ECB remaining relatively hawkish. In Italy, we even had worrying budget discussions again — and yet markets continue to climb.

It’s as if the only thing that matters is momentum and short-term positioning. Flows are driving everything, and fundamentals have taken the back seat. When I look at the daily candles, it just looks robotic. Every intraday dip gets bought automatically, and there's no real selling pressure — as if volatility itself has been ""priced out"" by design.

1608240922.0,StockMarket,Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology,"Stock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

&#x200B;

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

&#x200B;

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

&#x200B;

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

&#x200B;

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more. 

&#x200B;

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

&#x200B;

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

&#x200B;

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

&#x200B;

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

&#x200B;

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”. 

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1.    Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.

2.    Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.

3.    IV Percentile  – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.

4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.

5.    Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.

&#x200B;

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6.    Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7.    Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8.    Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.

- I've added live millisecond price updates from IEX
- I've added a fancy buy/sell/hold indicator that tells you what to do (hint: HODL)
- I've added [**awesome 3D charting**](https://imgur.com/a/CEY0urV), because why analyze your stocks in only two dimensions when you could do it in three?
- On Fin3D (aforementioned awesome 3D charting), I've added the ability to compare multiple companies and build custom charts comparing items from different financial statements
- I've fixed several annoying bugs

Coming in 2019:

- Upgrade to IEX Cloud will provide all kinds of awesome extras, like intraday real time level 2 data, better short interest data and a better news feed
- Custom 2D charting to supplement the awesome 3D charting
- Automated red flag detection which looks for accounting shenanigans and earnings manipulation
- Sentiment analysis for SEC filings and news
- A screener, so you can find ideas that don't suck, and will actually make you money

Oh, and since we're now all poor because the market is tanking and we spent what little money we had buying holiday gifts for our loved ones at Dollar General, it's completely free to use. 

As always, let me know if you have any feedback/feature requests/questions, or if you hate it and want it to burn like SPX (hint: you won't)

Stocks were mostly higher on Wednesday after new data showed muted levels of inflation in consumer goods, helping quell fears of a rapid jump in prices during the economic recovery. Treasury yields retreated following the report. The 10-year Treasury yield is at 1.521% at the time of writing. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.46% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.59% up. After recordings its best day since April 2020, the Nasdaq fell 0.29%.

The [Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) on Tuesday showed core consumer prices increased less than expected in February.{prices paid by consumers rose only 1.3% in February over last year, coming in below the 1.4% increase expected and slowing from the prior month. While it may not seem like a lot, the report helps quell fears that as economic activity increased and more stimulus was unleashed into the economy, inflationary pressures would begin to materialize. This also suggests the Federal Reserve can maintain its accommodative monetary policy and avoid rising interest rates for the foreseeable future. 

Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco said of inflationary jitters: “ “There’s the irony that in year one of a market recovery everybody doubts it and says how can this be happening if the economy isn’t good, and then in year two everybody struggles to assess whether \[the economy has\] just gotten too good too fast and it’s too hot. And so the last few days have been the latter story: Markets being disrupted by concerns of inflation and higher rates and premature Fed tightening. And today’s a little bit of a reprieve on that story as rates come down a bit and investors can start thinking about longer duration assets again.”

Today, in Washington DC, the House of Representatives is set to vote on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed by the Senate over the weekend. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify, is expected to easily pass and be signed into law by President Biden in the coming days.

1606748568.0,StockMarket,Palantir Adds $17 Billion in Value in Best Week Since Debut," Palantir Technologies Inc. posted its best week since it went public in September, adding about $17 billion in market value as a broad rally in tech stocks helped fuel gains in the software maker.

Its shares rose 52% since Monday and touched a fresh intraday record at $33.50. The stock lost some of the gains on Friday after Citron Research said in a tweet it was shorting the stock with a $20 target. The company ended the session at $27.66.

Palantir representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“A lot of institutions have probably warmed up to the company and are viewing it as something to hold onto for the long term,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “It’s a great software company, and it has a terrific business, a very sticky business, not just with governments but also enterprises.”

Trading in Palantir options also surged this week with average daily volume of call contracts jumping about 250% in the first three days of the week when compared to the prior week. An analysis of open interest shows most of the contracts being opened and closed in the same day, indicating a heavy presence of day traders.

After an initial lackluster performance following its direct-listing stock debut, gains for the Denver-based firm, which sells data-analysis tools, have accelerated after hedge funds, including Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, reported purchasing the company’s shares.

“Big-data companies have become very important and historically have been excellent stocks. Also, Palantir is benefiting from the pandemic -- tracking cases and analyzing data is right in its wheelhouse,” Kaufman said.

Since starting up in 2003, co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel has helped bankroll the business throughout its long period as a closely held business. Now, the stock has gained nearly 300% since its direct listing. It reported third-quarter losses in its first financial results since going public as compensation costs surged. It did, however, boost its revenue growth forecast for the year to 44%, exceeding the amount analysts expected on average.

“I’d say the days of it trading below $20 are probably over,” Kaufman added.

(Bloomberg) -- Hertz Global Holdings Inc. shares plunged after the car-rental company posted a larger-than-expected loss in the first quarter, pressured by a slowdown in customer bookings.

Revenue fell 13% in the period, contributing to an adjusted loss of $1.12 per share, the company said in a statement late Monday. Analysts had expected a 99-cent deficit on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

The company showed declines on multiple key metrics. While forward bookings from leisure customers were up from a year ago, demand from corporate and government customers has moderated.

Hertz moved to sell older models and buy newer cars before President Donald Trump’s tariffs raised their prices. About 70% of the company’s fleet is less than a year old, which should drive down future depreciation costs, Chief Executive Officer Gil West said Tuesday on the company’s investor call.

“We have a younger fleet that’s well equipped to navigate today’s uncertainty,” West said. He added the company worked closely with automakers in the first quarter to accept vehicle deliveries “ahead of schedule to avoid tariff exposure.”

West said the timing of Hertz’s fleet moves meant the company lost some business in certain markets and he acknowledged that the company faces economic uncertainty.

While Hertz is “accelerating its transition strategy and has some benefits on depreciation, we believe the risk ahead is on demand,” Barclays analyst Dan Levy wrote in a research report. He noted that the first-quarter miss was primarily in the Americas.

Hertz shares fell 17% at 1:48 p.m. Tuesday in New York. The stock had gained 90% this year through Monday’s close.

Hertz is offering fewer cars for rent as it freshens its fleet and contends with the trade war that has rattled markets and consumer sentiment. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management has amassed a nearly 20% stake in the rental car company, in a part as a bet that tariffs will drive up the value of Hertz’s fleet. Ackman has said that he thinks the worst is behind Hertz, though he expects near-term results will be weak.

Ackman’s stake lost $71 million during intraday trading at 1:45 p.m. in New York. His $352 million position is still up about $4 million from April 16, the day before he disclosed his position in an X post.

Hertz said on the earnings call that it expects to break even on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the second quarter and achieve positive net income in the third quarter of this year. Its first-quarter adjusted Ebitda loss was $325 million, worse than analysts expected.

One culprit for missing estimates was a shortfall in revenue, which was $1.8 billion, while analysts expected $2 billion. The company’s vehicle utilization rate climbed to 79%, up 3 percentage points from a year ago, but still historically weak. Revenue per day also fell 5% to $53.38. That was partly caused by having too many vehicles in some markets, Hertz Chief Commercial Officer Sandeep Dube told analysts on the call.

“All told, we didn’t get the utility out of these additional vehicles that we normally would have and probably left some price on the table,” Dube said.

Hertz said it’s on track to reduce depreciation on its cars to less than $300 per month per vehicle in the second quarter, earlier than expected.

This was the first quarter in which Hertz is no longer unloading electric vehicles, which renters shunned and resulted in high repair costs. The strategy misstep led to $2.9 billion in losses last year. Hertz earlier this year said it achieved its goal of selling off 30,000 battery-powered cars.",38,16,"Hertz Tumble 20% After Worse-Than-Expected Quarterly Loss * No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-shares-tumble-worse-expected-134450333.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-shares-tumble-worse-expected-134450333.html)

Stocks hit record levels again today despite disappointing data on job creation in November. The DOW and S&P 500 each hit a record-high intraday, led by energy and financial stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 0.8% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.84%, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.41% up.

Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer (PFE) is experiencing supply chain issues that could result in only half of the estimated vaccines entering distribution. Pfizer, along with partner BioNTech (BNTX) announced plans to ship 50 million vaccines by year-end, half of the 100 million doses previously expected. The company says it still anticipates delivering over 1 billion doses by the end of 2021.

Today, the Labor Department released their November jobs report, which showed the slowest pace of job growth since April’s record spike in unemployment. Non-farm payrolls grew by just 245,000, much lower than the 460,000 expected. The deceleration in recovery is likely due to the record spike in infections this month and the reimposition of certain restrictions across the United States. However, it is important to note that recent job data has surprised to the upside. The weekly unemployment reported released yesterday showed the first drop in new unemployment claims in three weeks.

As market participants and economist upgrade their estimates for 2021, many believe that cyclical and rotation stocks, like energy, financial, and reopening stocks,  that were hardest hit by the pandemic will extend gains into next year. Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual said, “As you move into 2021, there will be broader economic growth, it will be more inclusive, you will see continued fiscal stimulus – I do believe we will get a package. You’ll see the Fed continue. You have pent-up demand. Think about the rotation that we’ve been talking about … it’s underway right now and it will continue into 2021. Think value, think small-cap, think emerging markets.”

Unfortunately, the United States once again set single-day records for new infections and deaths yesterday. According to Johns Hopkins University, there were more 211,762 new cases and 2,858 deaths reported yesterday, overtaking the previous record of 205,000 new infections and 2,760 deaths set yesterday. California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he would impose extremely strict stay-at-home orders when intensive care units reach less than 15% availability, which he expects to happen soon. The stay-at-home restrictions will begin with 48 hours’ notice and remain in place for at least three weeks once they are ordered. Gov. Newsom said, “If we don’t act now, our hospital system will be overwhelmed. If we don’t act now, we will continue to see the death rate climb,”

Non-farm payrolls grew by just 245,000, much lower than the 460,000 expected. The deceleration in recovery is likely due to the record spike in infections this month and the reimposition of certain restrictions across the United States. However, it is important to note that recent job data has surprised to the upside. The weekly unemployment reported released yesterday showed the first drop in new unemployment claims in three weeks.

As market participants and economist upgrade their estimates for 2021, many believe that cyclical and rotation stocks, like energy, financial, and reopening stocks,  that were hardest hit by the pandemic will extend gains into next year. Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual said, “As you move into 2021, there will be broader economic growth, it will be more inclusive, you will see continued fiscal stimulus – I do believe we will get a package. You’ll see the Fed continue. You have pent-up demand. Think about the rotation that we’ve been talking about … it’s underway right now and it will continue into 2021. Think value, think small-cap, think emerging markets.”

Unfortunately, the United States once again set single-day records for new infections and deaths yesterday. According to Johns Hopkins University, there were more 211,762 new cases and 2,858 deaths reported yesterday, overtaking the previous record of 205,000 new infections and 2,760 deaths set yesterday. California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he would impose extremely strict stay-at-home orders when intensive care units reach less than 15% availability, which he expects to happen soon. The stay-at-home restrictions will begin with 48 hours’ notice and remain in place for at least three weeks once they are ordered. Gov. Newsom said, “If we don’t act now, our hospital system will be overwhelmed. If we don’t act now, we will continue to see the death rate climb,”

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Tesla invests $1.5 billion in bitcoin, which soared to all-time high

> * Tesla, in a SEC filing, said the electric auto maker has purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin after changing its investment policy last month. Bitcoin soared over $43,000 in an all-time high Monday. The Tesla filing also said, “We expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been talking up bitcoin and dogecoin, another cryptocurency, in recent tweets. Shares of Tesla rose in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 3. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 5. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Tesla invests $1.5 billion in bitcoin, which soared to all-time high

> * Tesla, in a SEC filing, said the electric auto maker has purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin after changing its investment policy last month. Bitcoin soared over $43,000 in an all-time high Monday. The Tesla filing also said, “We expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been talking up bitcoin and dogecoin, another cryptocurency, in recent tweets. Shares of Tesla rose in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 3. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 5. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.

1606856400.0,StockMarket,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, December 1, 2020","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 1, 2020**

Stocks continued rising today, with each of the major indices hitting fresh intraday record, before selling off somewhat in the last hour of the market. Market participants are eager to extend gains after a historic November performance. The Dow posted its biggest monthly gain since January 1987 with an advance of nearly 11.9%. In the S&P 500, the energy, financials, and industrials sectors led the index’s 10.8% rise, as market participants rotated back into many of the names that had been beaten down the hardest earlier on during the pandemic in the wake of positive vaccine news.

The positive vaccine news led analysts to raise their predictions for 2021 after Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN) each reported promising vaccine data in their clinical trial, raising hopes that an effective solution to the pandemic could roll out relatively soon. Fundstrat Managing Partner Tom Lee said in a note Monday he believed the S&P 500 would end 2020 at 3,800, implying another nearly 5% upside for the index. However, given the surge of coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe, Jerome Powell tempered optimism. He said, “Recent news on the vaccine front is very positive for the medium term. For now, significant challenges and uncertainties remain, including timing, production and distribution, and efficacy across different groups.

According to Worldometer, as of Tuesday, there are 13,919,870 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. According to the same chart, 274,332 people have died from the virus in the U.S., and 8,222,879 have recovered so far. In the month of November alone, the US added more than 4 million cases, double the amount from October, according to the Johns Hopkins University. There were around 168,000 new cases reported Tuesday, with health officials expecting worse to come given the travel that took place during Thanksgiving in the US.

**Highlights**

* Zoom (ZM) reported way better-than-expected earnings but the market was not impressed, stock down more than 15% at the time of writing.
   * EPS of $0.99 vs $0.75 estimate 
   * Revenue of $777.2 million vs. $694.5 million estimate. Revenue is up 366.5% on a year-over-year basis.
* Zoom (ZM) rated by many reputable analysts as NEUTRAL or EQUAL-WEIGHT with price target very close to current levels. Seems analysts not expecting much from Zoom after earnings.
* U.S. airlines could receive $17 billion for four months of payroll support under a new $908 billion bipartisan Senate COVID-19 relief proposal, a spokeswoman for Senator Mark Warner said Tuesday. We’ll keep you posted if there are any developments.
* Amazon (AMZN) is bringing its AWS cloud-services to the Macintosh operating system for the first time, allowing developers to create apps for iPhones, Macs, and other Apple (AAPL) devices
* Bank of America has officially joined other U.S. banking majors in refusing to finance oil and gas exploration in the pristine section of Alaska that President Trump last month opened to drilling for the first time ever.
* According to Adobe, Cyber Monday sales reached $10.84 billion, rising more than 15% year over year. That is at the low end of the 15% to 35% range the firm projected, but still makes it the largest online shopping day in U.S. history. Adobe now expects online sales to reach $184 billion for the holiday season as whole, down from a prior estimate of $189 billion.
* The total monthly sum bet legally on sports in the US likely topped $3 billion for the first time in October, according to analysts at Benchmark, citing state-level data, a new record. We particularly like DraftKings (DKNG) in this space.

1739057841.0,StockMarket,How have you been adjusting to this crazy volatility lately (trump market),"The recent volatility driven by geopolitical commentary has created unprecedented intraday swings. One headline can trigger triple-digit index moves within minutes, turning routine trades into high-stakes gambles. To manage risk, I’ve reduced position sizes significantly and narrowed my focus to shorter timeframes (5-15 minute windows) for scalping liquidity-driven moves.  

Curious how others are adjusting:  
- Are you prioritizing tighter stops or altering leverage ratios?  
- Focusing on sectors less reactive to news cycles (e.g., utilities, staples)?  
- Using volatility indicators (VIX, volume spikes) as confluence alongside technicals?  
- Shifting to futures/options for defined-risk exposure?  

Share your strategic adjustments—whether it’s scaling into partials, hedging with macro correlations, or revising profit targets. How are you structuring trades to navigate this environment without overexposure?  

I feel like the smartest idea here is just to not trade at all until this clears up?

1738873667.0,StockMarket,What's Driving Bank Stocks to Skyrocket? Even WFC Is Up Over 45% Since I Sold! (MS WFC C Société Générale),"I've been watching in disbelief as bank stocks have been on a tear lately. en Wells Fargo (WFC) has surged more than 45% since I sold my shares. y alone, Société Générale jumped by 10%. Wh's fueling this meteoric rise?

Loing at the past six months, several major banks have posted impressive gains:

* **Wells Fargo :** Over e past six months, WFC has seen a significant increase in its stock price, reflecting strong performance and investor confidence.
* **Morgan Chase :** JPM has so experienced a notable upward trend, with its stock appreciating considerably during the same period.
* **Citygroup :** Similarly, Citigroup's stock has climbed, showcasing robust growth over the last half-year.

European banks also experiencing a resurgence. By April 2024, STOXX 600 Banks index reached levels not seen since 2015, indicating a robust recovery in the sector.

Is this surge driven by improved earnings, favorable economic conditions, or something else? I'm eager to hear insights from the community on what's propelling bank stocks into orbit.

The worst scenario for those who panic sold will be if they miss out on an entire market recovery. 

If the US does NOT fall into a recession, they will be forced to buy back into SP500 at ATH later this year, and have incurred permanent losses.

Here’s the extensive data:

EARNINGS ESTIMATES IMPLY BACK TO ATH IF RECESSION IS AVOIDED

The S&P 500 is 10% off it's all-time high, yet price targets haven't budged and now imply index upside of 18% (93rd percentile rank). If fundamentals remain strong and keep price targets steady, this type of move has historically been good for forward returns.

MARKET PLUMBING IS CLEARED OUT

CTA flush is now over and according to Goldman CTA strategist Cullen Morgan, CTAs are now SHORT -$10bn of US equities after selling -$39bn in the last 5 sessions, and fully burning through their entire ~$200BN long as of mid-February. 

Morgan points out something everyone who has been trading in recent days know all too well: ""There have only been 15 other instances of similar/greater magnitude in our dataset. Outside of three bouts in 2023, they all occurred in 2018 and 2020."" Those who say today feels like the covid liquidations, you are not wrong.

CTAs are now done selling US stocks in pretty much any scenario.

THE MARKET BEAR NARRATIVE IS NOW INCONSISTENT WITH DXY, RATES, INFLATION DATA AND AI TRADE FUNDAMENTALS

Oil down.
Rates down.
Truflation at lowest level in 4 years.
Dollar down.
Credit spreads stable.
All in reference to the last few weeks btw.

Note that every company that guided in late January/early February incorporated a strong dollar into their guidance.  Weak dollar really good for large, global American companies.

GPU spot retail availability is down post Deepseek.
GPU spot rental pricing up post Deepseek.  
Google raising contract GPU rental pricing.
DRAM spot prices go up every day.  
China buying every GPU they can post Deepseek.  
TSM February growth accelerated YoY vs. January.
GTC next week.

Massive degrossing in the long leg of the momentum factor; by some measures the sharpest down move ever in this period of time.

Nasdaq down roughly the same magnitude/velocity as the Covid crash.

FII institute speech was less than 20 days ago.  Trump opened his speech focusing on how much the equity markets were up since his election.  I think he still cares despite all the rhetoric to the contrary.  “No crying in the casino,” etc.

I think there is a little too much confidence that the administration *wants* a recession.  They are most focused on the deficit and a recession would obviously be negative for the deficit.

SENTIMENT FAVORS SNAPBACK

1.Inverted $VIX Curve: The 1-month vs. 3-month VIX ratio is currently at 1.13, an extreme level seen only twice in the past five years. Historically, such inversions have marked key market inflection points (notably at the 3-month and 6-month horizons).


2.Momentum Basket Breakdown: The all-momentum basket, which tracks names with 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month momentum, has declined 28% during this 14-day unwind—its worst-ever 14-day stretch and the second-largest downward move in its history.


3.Tech RSI Levels: 54% of software stocks and 41% of TMT stocks are currently oversold, marking the highest levels seen in five years. This suggests extreme selling pressure and potential for a technical rebound.


4.$QQQ Put Activity: During this unwind, 37.4 million QQQ put contracts were traded—an all-time record for any rolling 14-day period.


5.Historical Drawdowns:
•NDX: Down 13% in this drawdown, compared to the 15-year median max annual drawdown of 12%.
•NDX dropped 3.8% just yesterday, ranking among the largest single-day moves in recent history.
•SPX: Down 9% in this drawdown, relative to its 15-year median max annual drawdown of 10%.


6.High-Yield Spreads: The CDX HY CDSI GEN 5Y SPREAD Corp index widened by 49 basis points during this unwind. While not extreme, this shift indicates increased credit risk pricing.


7.$NDX Advance-Decline Index: Currently at its 3rd lowest level in the past 18 months, signaling broad weakness across Nasdaq stocks.


8.TICK Index: Recorded its 5th lowest reading in six months, indicating significant intraday selling pressure.


9.VIX Levels: The VIX is at its 3rd highest level in the past two years, reflecting heightened volatility expectations.


10.ETF Share of Volume: The share of ETF volume has risen sharply, a common indicator of heightened market anxiety and panic-driven flows.


11.SPX Oversold Conditions: The SPX RSI fell below 30 for the first time since late 2022. While it has flirted with this level in recent months, it has never truly closed below it.


12.NDX Oversold Conditions: The NDX RSI has dropped below 30, marking its most oversold condition since early 2022 (though it has hovered near this level before without a full breakdown).


13.AAII Bull/Bear Sentiment: The bull-to-bear ratio has reached its 13th most bearish reading since 1987 (based on 1,960 data points). This is the lowest sentiment level recorded since 2022. Historically, the average bull/bear ratio since 1987 is 1.43.


14.CNN Fear & Greed Index: Currently at an extreme fear reading of 17. Additionally, CNBC aired a “Markets in Turmoil” segment, which historically correlates with significant market lows.


15.Market Sentiment Yesterday: The market was dominated by capitulation-style selling, speculation about a breakdown, and broad pessimism—conditions often observed near market bottoms. Additionally, “pain levels” (trader losses) were at 10/10, suggesting extreme fear.


16.Bond Market Activity: The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped by 10 basis points earlier in the session, reflecting a flight to safety on recession concerns.


17.Market Positioning & Flows: Major sentiment indicators suggest the market is fully loaded with bearish positioning, with a notable shift into safe-haven assets. Meanwhile, crowded momentum longs across APAC markets were liquidated at the close, indicating broad risk-off behavior.

1611756183.0,StockMarket,Stocks to Watch 27/01/2021,"Good Morning,

Another really odd day yesterday with stocks fluctuating like crazy. The whole market is irrationally strong which can be good, but incredibly risky. If you're new to trading I'd really recommend trading in a simulator in conditions like these. Here is my watchlist for today. A lot of the names here are still experiencing momentum from yesterday - be wary for reversals. 

1. **$AMC (AMC Entertainment) -** Highest gapper today. This has been a heavily shorted stock for a while since the start of COVID but has just announced new funding which is driving AMC this morning. Yesterday provided some opportunities for AMC but I missed this, unfortunately. With NYSE listed stocks like this, we need to be wary of stock halts and so risk management plays an important role. Premarket high is at $17.90 at the moment so I'll be watching for a breakout over 18.
2. **$GME (Gamestop)** \- I'm trying to work out if GME will break out again today and, given the past week, anything could happen. I try to just focus on the intraday charts for stocks like these and looking purely for technical patterns I recognise. It's currently below the VWAP (VWAP at 255 at time of writing). If it can get over the VWAP, I'll be looking for a move up to 277.
3. **$EXPR (Express) -** This is our second highest gapper right now, most likely due to some sympathy momentum from social media. I really hate trading stocks with no significant catalyst, but if this follows a similar pattern to GME, I will try to ride the momentum.
4. **$KOSS (Koss Corp)** \- 43% short interest here so we are seeing a lot of short-sellers get squeezed out. Similar situation to yesterday. 

Momentum today will be quite scattered I believe so it's important to watch multiple stocks and set alerts at points of interest. There is a lot of stuff going on today and a lot of people will be watching different stocks. 

Other stocks I will be watching: UONE, OXBR, KODK.

As a reminder, trading is risky, make sure you put stops in place and follow your initial plan regardless.

Thanks all.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ([\^DJI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI)) dropped around 0.9%, or 350 points.

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

News: [Union Pacific to acquire Norfolk Southern in 85 Billion Deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/union-pacific-to-acquire-norfolk-southern-in-85-billion-deal?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**SRPT (Sarepta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SRPT&p=d)\-The FDA concluded ""the death of an 8-year-old in Brazil was unrelated to ELEVIDYS treatment and has recommended that Sarepta resume shipments for ambulatory individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"". This has caused the stock to surge afterhours yesterday. Interestingly, the stock was worth $35 before the ELEVIDYS news even happened, but we haven't resurged. So I'm a little wary of this because we haven't been going back all the way. Worth watching at the open.

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-UnitedHealth issued a revised 2025 adj. earnings guidance of $16 per share, below the expectations of $20.40. The company also reported Q2 adjusted EPS of $4.08 on revenue of $111.6B, missing expectations. Overall not interested in this unless we hit near lows again of $250 again, which was the max pain point from the UnitedHealth facing DOJ investigation over Medicare billing catalyst in the past.

[**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)\-Novo Nordisk has cut its full-year 2025 U.S. sales growth outlook to 8%-14% from 13%-21% and lowered operating profit forecast to 10%-16% from 16%-24%. Additionally, the company appointed a new CEO (Maziar Mike Doustdar) Maziar Mike Doustdar as the new CEO, effective August 7. 

From what I've read online, many people expected the CEO to be an American (because the main market for the weight-loss drugs is America because our obesity rate is so high). But I doubt that's a major factor in affecting stock price. We've essentially bled from 70 ->50 and had a slight bounce intraday, so I'm interested to see if we sell off again at the open/during market hours.

1665686326.0,StockMarket,Data shows AMC insiders got rich off retail traders," 

At least some people got pretty rich from AMC’s two-year stock roller coaster, but it wasn’t the company’s super loyal, buy-and-hold investors known as the ""Apes.""

A Fox Business analysis shows that company insiders such as hedge funds, private equity firms, as well as board members, top executives and other big investors in the world’s largest movie theater chain sold a staggering $883.5 million in stock over the past two years at prices significantly higher than they are today.

According to information from Dataroma, a website that tracks the portfolios of prominent investors and their real-time stock transactions, the most significant chunk of stock sales came from PE firm Silver Lake, hedge fund Mudrick Capital and Wanda America Entertainment, part of China-based conglomerate Wanda Group. Combined, they unloaded $782 million of stock.

But company officials, such as CEO Adam Aron, AMC’s chief financial officer and human resources chief, sold $101.5 million in stock in a series of particularly well-timed and lucrative transactions. These sales occurred after AMC joined the so-called meme stock craze in early 2021, and an army of retail investors began snapping up shares, pushing prices to the moon. Data also shows those company insiders have bought no shares on the secondary market in the past two years.

Shares of AMC have since declined precipitously amid continued operating losses and after management recently announced a new plan to sell stock and dilute investors. Critics of the company say the insider sales underscore how big investors and company executives profited mightily from the loyalty – and some say the lack of market sophistication – of AMC’s predominantly retail or small investor shareholder base.

These shareholders, who call themselves the ""Apes,"" began buying the stock based on tips and gossip spread on Reddit chat rooms and social media during the early days of the pandemic shutdowns. With the Fed keeping interest rates at near zero and printing money, stocks of speculative companies like AMC, computer-game retailer GameStop and retailer Bed Bath & Beyond began to soar and remained elevated for months after.

The heavy Ape buying boosted shares and also allowed AMC to avoid bankruptcy following its own pandemic closures of theaters across the country. Management then used the elevated stock price to recapitalize and pay down some debt.

The Dataroma analysis also shows that management may have used the buying frenzy to get rich.

Case in point: AMC’s voluble CEO Adam Aron, who courted the Apes in social media posts and even private meetings, earned $43 million from his insider sales at prices well above the current single-digit value of AMC stock. Shares of AMC have fallen nearly 90% from their highs of a year ago.

""Adam Aron, the AMC executives, and the board ran an enrichment scheme at the expense of individual investors who actually saved the company,"" said former hedge fund trader Marc Cohodes, a frequent critic of AMC management.

The market losses have been particularly acute for retail holders and others who bailed on the stock only recently. In fact, given the recent declines, only those investors who snapped up shares before or around the beginning of the meme frenzy when the stock hovered at around $5 and below would still be in the green. Shares of AMC (considering a recent stock split with the creation of a new preferred stock) closed Wednesday at a combined $7.49.

DILUTING RETAIL WHILE AVOIDING BANKRUPTCY

Insiders selling their stock is not illegal, of course. In fact, it is quite common in corporate America, where executives often cite ""estate planning"" for the sales. Executive compensation plans include significant amounts of stock option awards to senior management to align their interests with the interests of shareholders.

Securities regulators mandate disclosure of these insider sales to help alert the investing public of how management may view the company’s business prospects. During much of the period of insider selling, AMC’s financials improved somewhat, particularly after several blockbuster theatrical releases such as ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" which broke box-office records earlier this year, generating $1.4 billion in worldwide ticket sales after 14 weeks.

But AMC faced existential issues even before the shutdown. Headwinds include the rise of streaming, which continues to depress ticket sales, and a significant debt load used to finance past expansion. AMC continues to lose money, albeit at a slower clip, and its box office revenues remain below pre-pandemic levels.

The tough operating environment recently forced one of its competitors, Cineworld, to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Aron has said that AMC will avoid a similar fate based on past recapitalization plans and a more recent one where he created a new preferred stock, known as the ""Ape,"" a homage to his loyal retail investor base.

Surviving bankruptcy will come at a cost for retail holders, who comprise 90% of all AMC’s investors. The creation of the Ape is the equivalent of a stock split, and it sets the stage for the significant sale of stock and dilution of shares in the weeks to come.

In SEC filings, and repeated in media reports, AMC has warned investors that its shares are over-valued based on standard metrics and to be prepared ""to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" Then, in late September, when AMC announced plans to sell as much as 425 million new Ape shares, Aron described the move as ""good dilution"" to help AMC avoid a fate similar to Cineworld.

But his comments were widely criticized by analysts because such a term doesn’t exist, and dilution almost always leads to investor losses because it increases share counts even if it aids in a company’s survival. Because the Ape is a preferred stock and not common shares, the dilution doesn’t need shareholder approval, unlike prior attempts that investors voted down.

""The situation retail investors find themselves in now is a reflection on management,"" Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese told FOX Business. ""AMC is completely wiping out and diluting its investors who have continued to flee.""

INSIDERS CASHING OUT BIG TIME

And that’s after the insiders began cashing out of the stock. Take Mudrick Capital. Before the meme stock craze began, the New York-based hedge fund sold $26.7 million of its AMC stake in December 2020. The stock price then ranged from $2.50 to $3.40.

Then, in June, AMC disclosed in an SEC filing that it had entered into an agreement with Mudrick Capital, a large creditor and investor, to raise an additional $230.5 million. The company raised the money by selling 8.5 million shares of AMC stock at $27.12 per share.

The stock rallied on the news. The same day the sale was announced, the stock hit an intraday high of $33.53, Mudrick sold its entire stake for an undisclosed profit. Based on that stock price, Mudrick could have netted more than $40 million in the trade. A Mudrick press official had no immediate comment.

Silver Lake, which held a board seat, sold $534.8 million in AMC stock in the opening days of the meme mania, selling at prices ranging from $14 to $24 a share. A Silver Lake press official had no immediate comment.

Wanda Entertainment, another board member, sold $220.7 million of its AMC stake between Feb. 1 and March 20 of 2021 at prices of between $13.98 and $14.60, according to Dataroma. Wanda press officials had no immediate comment.

Several AMC corporate insiders appear to have timed their sales even better than the hedge fund traders, the Dataroma report indicates. For instance, on June 3, 2021, just one day after AMC touched its all-time intraday high of $72.62, directors Anthony Saich and Gary Locke each sold shares worth $600,000 and $1.7 million, at $58.50 and $49.82, respectively. 

That same day, Daniel Ellis, the company’s senior vice president of global development; John McDonald, the executive vice president of U.S. operations; and HR chief Carla Chavarria sold $681,659, $1.71 million and $2.5 million worth of shares, respectively, at prices of $49.52, $56.59 and $62.67. 

Later that year, in November, the company’s Chief Financial Officer Sean Goodman made $6.6 million by unloading his stock at $39.21 and $40.36 per share. So far this year, Goodman has sold $3.4 million of his stock holdings at prices ranging from $18 to $22.98 a share.

Aron, 68, has been CEO since 2015. He sold just over $42 million of his AMC holdings in three chunks beginning in November 2021 through January 2022 at prices ranging from $22.84, $30.86 and $40.52 a share.

Aron disclosed his planned sales on an earnings call in August 2021 and said he would use the proceeds for estate planning purposes. On an earnings call in January 2022, he said, ""Those sales are now finished.""

With the Fed keeping interest rates at near zero and printing money, stocks of speculative companies like AMC, computer-game retailer GameStop and retailer Bed Bath & Beyond began to soar and remained elevated for months after.

The heavy Ape buying boosted shares and also allowed AMC to avoid bankruptcy following its own pandemic closures of theaters across the country. Management then used the elevated stock price to recapitalize and pay down some debt.

The Dataroma analysis also shows that management may have used the buying frenzy to get rich.

Case in point: AMC’s voluble CEO Adam Aron, who courted the Apes in social media posts and even private meetings, earned $43 million from his insider sales at prices well above the current single-digit value of AMC stock. Shares of AMC have fallen nearly 90% from their highs of a year ago.

""Adam Aron, the AMC executives, and the board ran an enrichment scheme at the expense of individual investors who actually saved the company,"" said former hedge fund trader Marc Cohodes, a frequent critic of AMC management.

The market losses have been particularly acute for retail holders and others who bailed on the stock only recently. In fact, given the recent declines, only those investors who snapped up shares before or around the beginning of the meme frenzy when the stock hovered at around $5 and below would still be in the green. Shares of AMC (considering a recent stock split with the creation of a new preferred stock) closed Wednesday at a combined $7.49.

DILUTING RETAIL WHILE AVOIDING BANKRUPTCY

Insiders selling their stock is not illegal, of course. In fact, it is quite common in corporate America, where executives often cite ""estate planning"" for the sales. Executive compensation plans include significant amounts of stock option awards to senior management to align their interests with the interests of shareholders.

Securities regulators mandate disclosure of these insider sales to help alert the investing public of how management may view the company’s business prospects. During much of the period of insider selling, AMC’s financials improved somewhat, particularly after several blockbuster theatrical releases such as ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" which broke box-office records earlier this year, generating $1.4 billion in worldwide ticket sales after 14 weeks.

But AMC faced existential issues even before the shutdown. Headwinds include the rise of streaming, which continues to depress ticket sales, and a significant debt load used to finance past expansion. AMC continues to lose money, albeit at a slower clip, and its box office revenues remain below pre-pandemic levels.

The tough operating environment recently forced one of its competitors, Cineworld, to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Aron has said that AMC will avoid a similar fate based on past recapitalization plans and a more recent one where he created a new preferred stock, known as the ""Ape,"" a homage to his loyal retail investor base.

Surviving bankruptcy will come at a cost for retail holders, who comprise 90% of all AMC’s investors. The creation of the Ape is the equivalent of a stock split, and it sets the stage for the significant sale of stock and dilution of shares in the weeks to come.

In SEC filings, and repeated in media reports, AMC has warned investors that its shares are over-valued based on standard metrics and to be prepared ""to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" Then, in late September, when AMC announced plans to sell as much as 425 million new Ape shares, Aron described the move as ""good dilution"" to help AMC avoid a fate similar to Cineworld.

But his comments were widely criticized by analysts because such a term doesn’t exist, and dilution almost always leads to investor losses because it increases share counts even if it aids in a company’s survival. Because the Ape is a preferred stock and not common shares, the dilution doesn’t need shareholder approval, unlike prior attempts that investors voted down.

""The situation retail investors find themselves in now is a reflection on management,"" Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese told FOX Business. ""AMC is completely wiping out and diluting its investors who have continued to flee.""

INSIDERS CASHING OUT BIG TIME

And that’s after the insiders began cashing out of the stock. Take Mudrick Capital. Before the meme stock craze began, the New York-based hedge fund sold $26.7 million of its AMC stake in December 2020. The stock price then ranged from $2.50 to $3.40.

Then, in June, AMC disclosed in an SEC filing that it had entered into an agreement with Mudrick Capital, a large creditor and investor, to raise an additional $230.5 million. The company raised the money by selling 8.5 million shares of AMC stock at $27.12 per share.

The stock rallied on the news. The same day the sale was announced, the stock hit an intraday high of $33.53, Mudrick sold its entire stake for an undisclosed profit. Based on that stock price, Mudrick could have netted more than $40 million in the trade. A Mudrick press official had no immediate comment.

Silver Lake, which held a board seat, sold $534.8 million in AMC stock in the opening days of the meme mania, selling at prices ranging from $14 to $24 a share. A Silver Lake press official had no immediate comment.

Wanda Entertainment, another board member, sold $220.7 million of its AMC stake between Feb. 1 and March 20 of 2021 at prices of between $13.98 and $14.60, according to Dataroma. Wanda press officials had no immediate comment.

Several AMC corporate insiders appear to have timed their sales even better than the hedge fund traders, the Dataroma report indicates. For instance, on June 3, 2021, just one day after AMC touched its all-time intraday high of $72.62, directors Anthony Saich and Gary Locke each sold shares worth $600,000 and $1.7 million, at $58.50 and $49.82, respectively. 

That same day, Daniel Ellis, the company’s senior vice president of global development; John McDonald, the executive vice president of U.S. operations; and HR chief Carla Chavarria sold $681,659, $1.71 million and $2.5 million worth of shares, respectively, at prices of $49.52, $56.59 and $62.67. 

Later that year, in November, the company’s Chief Financial Officer Sean Goodman made $6.6 million by unloading his stock at $39.21 and $40.36 per share. So far this year, Goodman has sold $3.4 million of his stock holdings at prices ranging from $18 to $22.98 a share.

Aron, 68, has been CEO since 2015. He sold just over $42 million of his AMC holdings in three chunks beginning in November 2021 through January 2022 at prices ranging from $22.84, $30.86 and $40.52 a share.

Aron disclosed his planned sales on an earnings call in August 2021 and said he would use the proceeds for estate planning purposes. On an earnings call in January 2022, he said, ""Those sales are now finished.""

1745228901.0,StockMarket,Best Non-U.S. Stock Market Indexes,"Hello, everyone. I'm currently researching the best indexes for long-term investment, foreign to the U.S. that preferably have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 5 years.

Currently, I've researched about India's NIFTY 50, NIFTY 500 and although a little more volatile their NIFTY Small-Cap 250 which has a surprising 328% return over the last 5 years.

Furthermore, the DAX Index (Germany) has slightly more than doubled over the last 5 years, outperforming the S&P 500.

My question is, excluding ETFs, what other stock market indexes have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 5 years (86%+) that aren't American?

Also, please don't discuss that the S&P 500, NASDAQ 100 and other U.S. indexes are completely reliable investments, or deviations of the indexes I've listed above for Reddit karma, I know this and a majority of my equity is in the U.S.

Thanks.",4,10,"Best Non-U.S. Stock Market Indexes Hello, everyone. I'm currently researching the best indexes for long-term investment, foreign to the U.S. that preferably have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 5 years.

* **Apple hit a market cap of $3 trillion briefly during trading on Monday.**
* **The milestone is mostly symbolic but it represents investor recognition of Apple’s success over the past few years as the company has reported several record-breaking quarters of big growth in all of its product lines.**
* **Apple’s cash flow also makes the stock a safe haven during times of market uncertainty.**

Apple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion during intraday trading on Monday, before dropping back under the mark shortly afterwards. Apple broke the barrier when its share price hit $182.86.

Apple rose 2.5% on Monday to close at $182.01, just missing closing the trading day at the $3 trillion mark. 

The milestone is mostly symbolic but it shows investors remain bullish on Apple stock and its ability to grow. At a market value of $3 trillion, Apple tripled its valuation in under four years. And analysts see plenty of room to run.

Apple showed annual growth across all of its product categories in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year. While the iPhone is still the biggest sales driver, Apple’s services business grew 25.6% year-over-year and delivered more than $18 billion in revenue during the quarter. 

In December, for example, Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty raised the firm’s price target on Apple from $164 to $200, and maintained the equivalent of a buy rating, arguing that new products like virtual reality and augmented reality headsets aren’t yet baked into the share price.

Huberty also said she expects Apple’s App Store revenue to outperform Morgan Stanley’s forecasts for the quarter and for Apple to ship 83 million units during the December quarter, 3 million more than anticipated.

Apple sold 27 million pairs of its newest AirPods model over the holidays, driving 20% year-over-year growth for Apple’s wearables business during the quarter, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TFI Asset Management Limited said in a Monday note.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote on Sunday that the mark is a “watershed moment” but has more room to grow, especially since Ives values Apple’s services business at $1.5 trillion.

Investors also turned to Apple as a safe haven during recent market uncertainty, thanks to its strong balance sheet and prodigious cash flow, which it uses to invest in new products, stock buybacks and to return capital to shareholders through dividends.

Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap during intraday trading on Aug. 2, 2018. It hit a $2 trillion valuation just over two years later on Aug. 19, 2020.

Apple’s peers aren’t far behind. Microsoft is worth about $2.5 trillion, Amazon has about a $1.75 market cap and Google’s market valuation is just shy of $2 trillion.

This stock is ridiculously run up since IPO (\~4x it's opening price). Daily setup doesn’t look like a clean short, but watching to see if it mimics CRCL’s recent surge at the open yesterday. Interested in seeing if it breaks the highs ($166). Obviously CRWV has a huge debt load due to their GPUs/training chips, but whether this will actually affect the stock price remains to be seen.

Nestlé ($NESN) is up strongly after posting FY results that beat expectations and confirming its 2025 guidance.

* **Organic sales** rose +2.2% vs. the expected +2.1%
* **Margins** surprised positively in H2, and no cuts to FY25 guidance
* **Vontobel:** ""All key metrics slightly above expectations,"" easing concerns over margin cuts
* **Transparency on cost savings** reassures investors about profitability and cash generation

The stock has gained **5.2% YTD**, making it one of the best performers in the Swiss SMI index.

Nestlé's CEO also defended packaged foods amid criticism from incoming U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., emphasizing their role in food safety, waste reduction, and global nutrition.

I don’t even know how to express my joy… More than **20-25% of my assets** are in this stock! 🚀 📈

The economy boomed because of said trust. The erosion of trust and goodwill is already showing in the bond/stock markets.

With this in mind, I think the US will lag the rest of the world for at least a few years. So I have two additions to my portfolio:

- FLIA: 1-3 yr international bonds ETF

I’m thinking of rebalancing my portfolio to be made of ~40% like investments for the long haul.

1745678525.0,StockMarket,We don't make the rules but we have to play by them to outperform.,"Hi guys:

Yesterday at 1:38pm, Trump announced the following below. Coincidentally, QQQ was ramping up somewhat aggressively for close to 90min and headed to the resistance of the 50 day EMA. The Qs already gave a warning at 1:28pm when it was .39 away from the bottom of the EMA cloud and started to fade. Negative news pieces like this drop almost every time an index or stock are near resistance levels. The prudent move would be to buy puts here as close to the EMA as possible. If you look at the bigger picture, QQQ hasn't been above the 50 day ema since Feb 24th so it most certainly was going to act as resistance until it flips to support eventually. The news just made the flush more violent and quick and the indices did recover later but catching those moves can be nice for a decent intraday gain. Good luck, keep your eyes open during this crazy tape and can certainly bank well on this volatility.

[**SNOW (Snowflake)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d)\- SNOW reported adjusted EPS of $0.24 vs. $0.21 exp. Raised full-year product revenue guidance to $4.33B vs. $4.29B exp. Q2 product revenue guidance of $1.035B–$1.045B implies \~25% growth from some random SA article I read. Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-OpenAI announced the acquisition of Jony Ive's AI hardware startup for $6.4B. This is the first shot in what I consider the ""AI Consumer Hardware War"" (sorry Humane Pin, you don't count lol). This positions OpenAI to develop a new generation of AI-powered devices and could challenge Apple in the AI space. Stock fell intraday yesterday 2-3%, interested to see if we continue that selloff. Watching the 200 level as well. Apple has essentially fallen flat with AI (Apple Intelligence) and hasn't struck gold recently with any good hardware, we can safely consider the Apple Vision a bust.

[**FICO (FICO)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FICO&p=d)\-FHFA director William J. Pulte called for the provider of credit scores to be more ""economical"" and that FHFA is considering replacing the tri-merge credit score model with a bi-merge system to cut costs. Already long from $1700 yesterday, we're down close to 30% on a remark that thinks a $1.50 increase in its wholesale royalty for mortgage originations is too high. The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.

1743772364.0,StockMarket,Interesting Stocks Today (04/4) - China Strikes Back,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**China announced a 34% tariff on the US. The US may retaliate. ""Reciprocal"" tariffs can result in a positive feedback loop of the tariff percentage.**

News: [China Imposes 34 Tariffs On All Us Imports As Retaliation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/china-imposes-34-tariffs-on-all-us-imports-as-retaliation)

**AVGO, NXPI, LRCX, AMAT- (ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE 20%+ OF THEIR SALES COME FROM CHINA)**\- China imposing a 34% tariff on US imports escalates trade tensions and impacts supply chains, all of which have significant exposure to China. Overall, most are interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement. Approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comes from China. Interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there. The newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. AAPL is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.

China-related stocks are selling off due to expectations of retaliation from the US. Also currently just a ""watch"", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100.

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.

1601498034.0,StockMarket,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Wed Sept 30. Enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 30, 2020**

Stocks traded higher throughout the day before pulling back steeply in the last hour of trading in another extremely volatile day. While major benchmarks are up around 4% in the last five trading days, intraday volatility has been extreme, making options trading difficult. Traders weighed a wild presidential debate and developments among Congressional lawmakers for further fiscal stimulus. Stocks recovered in the last 20 minutes of the market, capping off an extremely volatile final hour.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.68% up, the S&P (SPY) finished the day 0.59% up, and the Dow (DIA) led the day finishing 0.99% up. 

Yesterday’s presidential debate between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden proved to be an extremely contentious affairs, with Trump frequently interrupting both Biden the moderator, Chris Wallace who could not control the candidates, and a slew of highly personal attacks from both sides. The Guardian branded the debate ‘a national humiliation’. With the election in 36 days, analysts expect volatility to increase as November 3rd gets closer. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said “I think markets are really nervous into those 36 days \[before the election\] and one of the things we have to think about is, when does nervousness price in the worst is yet to come? When do you think the worst is priced in? There’s $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines. I don’t think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when there’s 20% of the equity market sitting in cash. Investor cash — that’s excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates too. So you’ve got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.”

The election comes against a dire economic situation, especially in the labor, with major corporations recently announcing new rounds of job cuts. Disney (DIS) announced it was slashing 28,000 jobs in their theme parks, cruise line, and retailers. Shell (RDS) announced it was cutting 9,000 jobs as the pandemic has affected the demand for oil. According to CNN business, tens of thousands of airline jobs could be lost as soon as tomorrow, as a federal prohibition on job cuts in the industry expires. Airline executives say they are prepared to keep workers only if Congress approves $25 billion in grants. 

Congressional lawmakers and the Trump administration are attempting to come to a deal in the near-term to provide additional fiscal relief to the families and small businesses that are struggling in the pandemic. House Democrats are pushing forward with a new $2.2 trillion proposal as speaker Pelosi and the White House make a final attempt to strike a deal before the election. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin were unable to strike a deal after a 90-minute meeting. The pair said they will continue discussion as they continue to work to craft legislation that could pass both Houses of Congress. House Democrats are holding a vote on their plan today, a largely symbolic gesture as McConnel has already opposed the plan. Republicans are rumored to have a $1-1.5 trillion ceiling for any new relief legislation.

Stocks recovered in the last 20 minutes of the market, capping off an extremely volatile final hour.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.68% up, the S&P (SPY) finished the day 0.59% up, and the Dow (DIA) led the day finishing 0.99% up. 

Yesterday’s presidential debate between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden proved to be an extremely contentious affairs, with Trump frequently interrupting both Biden the moderator, Chris Wallace who could not control the candidates, and a slew of highly personal attacks from both sides. The Guardian branded the debate ‘a national humiliation’. With the election in 36 days, analysts expect volatility to increase as November 3rd gets closer. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said “I think markets are really nervous into those 36 days \[before the election\] and one of the things we have to think about is, when does nervousness price in the worst is yet to come? When do you think the worst is priced in? There’s $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines. I don’t think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when there’s 20% of the equity market sitting in cash. Investor cash — that’s excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates too. So you’ve got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.”

The election comes against a dire economic situation, especially in the labor, with major corporations recently announcing new rounds of job cuts. Disney (DIS) announced it was slashing 28,000 jobs in their theme parks, cruise line, and retailers. Shell (RDS) announced it was cutting 9,000 jobs as the pandemic has affected the demand for oil. According to CNN business, tens of thousands of airline jobs could be lost as soon as tomorrow, as a federal prohibition on job cuts in the industry expires. Airline executives say they are prepared to keep workers only if Congress approves $25 billion in grants. 

Congressional lawmakers and the Trump administration are attempting to come to a deal in the near-term to provide additional fiscal relief to the families and small businesses that are struggling in the pandemic. House Democrats are pushing forward with a new $2.2 trillion proposal as speaker Pelosi and the White House make a final attempt to strike a deal before the election. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin were unable to strike a deal after a 90-minute meeting. The pair said they will continue discussion as they continue to work to craft legislation that could pass both Houses of Congress. House Democrats are holding a vote on their plan today, a largely symbolic gesture as McConnel has already opposed the plan. Republicans are rumored to have a $1-1.5 trillion ceiling for any new relief legislation.

1615239549.0,StockMarket,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 8, 2021.","Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. 

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. 

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. 

Highlights
The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.

Shares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.

Roblox's IPO is set to take place on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol ""RBLX.""

""In my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?"" - Li Lu",205,56,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 8, 2021. Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. 

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. 

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. 

Highlights
The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.

Shares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.

Roblox's IPO is set to take place on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol ""RBLX.""

1720742260.0,StockMarket,I found the catalyst for the 2024 crash 2,"If you are not familiar with my thesis, it can be read below: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ad9qme/i\_found\_the\_catalyst\_for\_the\_2024\_crash/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ad9qme/i_found_the_catalyst_for_the_2024_crash/)

The TLDR of that thesis is that based on previous rate hiking, pausing and cutting cycles, we to some degree can predict the overall shape and potential time window markets have to rally then correct. 

In the last phases of the tech bubble and the housing bubble, the rate hiking cycle ALWAYS produced new all time highs. In my opinion anyways, the only reason markets stumbled at all in 2021 was the war. This unquestionably set in motion what was needed to accelerate what was going to become a building inflation problem anyways. 

Your pause phase ALWAYS ended higher. During the housing bubble, the pause phase saw a face ripping 22.5% rally from the date they last hiked rates to the 1st day they cut them. So many people are sitting around wondering how we got here and its just math/history/algos using all that. 

As per my last post, there were two metrics. Time and price. Oct 16, 2024 (this was based on how long the fed held rates during the housing bubble). The expected price if we rallied 22.5% was SPY 557.51 (based on July 26, 2023's closing price when the last rate hike took place). 

We have accomplished one but not the other. Interestingly enough it just so happens that apparently markets dont like going above this number. But I think this is psycology because any imbicile could calcuate what I calculated without much elbow grease at all.

You will notice as well that volume lately is a little light. For being excited about new all time highs, those recent selly days seem to be sporting more volume if you catch my drift. 

In my opinion, CPI was good today. Markets got what they were looking for in terms of expectations. The soft landing appears to be in tact. Theres really no other reason to sell up here aside from being over a pre calcuable number associated with the last market crash. No one wants to lose 60% from here like they did in the past so why risk it? 

I still don't think however this is the all time high. I lean more towards this coming sometime in Sept or Oct. The fed has to cut rates before we can start heading lower. Even when they cut, we have to expect retail traders will misread this as good news and push markets up a good 3-5% from whatever that number is. But that will be a really good crowd to sell your holdings to. SO I think theres more gas in the tank. No bearish positions until  after the cut, this to me is the way. 

Something has to happen right? You can't just have the economy fall apart for no percise reason. Some event usually happens. Like in the 2008 financial crisis, that big send down in Oct can be pinpointed to news congress did not pass a rescue bill but chose to delay it with further debate. So something has to break and get some awareness to it. 

I'm not going to go super deep into CRE aside from them loans are due at the end of this year. Whats going to happen when they have to refi? It's not like the values consistently declining year over year helps their loan to value at all:

This is wildly stark contrast to residential real estate.

So the problems still cookin, but its not due yet. October or sometime further out there seems more likely to be a time that will mark the top out. Certainly in the near term, people appear scared of these higher prices in the markets. 

Its not like we are even out of the woods on the presidential front either. I just heard Biden legitimatley call Trump his vice president when he was supposed to refer to Kamala Harris. Theres all the legal stuff with Trump being a felon and Biden coming accross as having dementia that is really stirring up the pot. I mean I can't remember a time when a presidents own party was actively advocating for him to not run again so close to the actual election. So all this is new stuff! It's very intersting. I don't care about politics or who wins at all, but I know its going to make for volatility. 

We go out to October, how do people feel about the election then? Theres going to be alot of people who want to be risk off for the outcome of this election. So when are they going to go risk off? It'll be in advance of it. 

In my opinion whoever wins is going to inherit the mess that turns into 2025 (assuming 2024 is basically 2007 and 08 is next year). We already got a bunch of retail  stocks getting nuked out here. LULU and NKE both are getting the business right now and thats a direct window into consumers not buying stuff they don't need anymore. Which can only mean people are becoming more poor. Which  can only mean profits will shrink and future values will have to be revised lower. 

It's all just a cascading domino. I dont know whats going to happen to the banks when CRE blows up or how long that blow up is going to last. Maybe we are due for a multi year pull back or its a nice 12 month 60% decline. Either way Its commin. 

What I will say is that ironically in the past these big bubble bursts see 60% declines. If you price out a 60% decline from our newest all time high of 561.67, you would get 224.67 for SPY. This would place you at pandemic lows. I say this is possible because in my prior posts, You can see how the housing bubble lows actually went to the tech bubble lows. Wild stuff.

This post is a little more about commentary than the data as much hasn't really changed. I still expct a higher all time high. Say SPY got to 600. Well 60% off of that number still places you back to 240. being at 240 is still within the march lows and lower than April 2020's low of 243.90. Why do I like to work backwards for price targets? Sometimes reading the last chapter of a book first, helps you understand your ensuing journey from the 1st chapter.

I still don't think however this is the all time high. I lean more towards this coming sometime in Sept or Oct. The fed has to cut rates before we can start heading lower. Even when they cut, we have to expect retail traders will misread this as good news and push markets up a good 3-5% from whatever that number is. But that will be a really good crowd to sell your holdings to. SO I think theres more gas in the tank. No bearish positions until  after the cut, this to me is the way. 

Something has to happen right? You can't just have the economy fall apart for no percise reason. Some event usually happens. Like in the 2008 financial crisis, that big send down in Oct can be pinpointed to news congress did not pass a rescue bill but chose to delay it with further debate. So something has to break and get some awareness to it. 

I'm not going to go super deep into CRE aside from them loans are due at the end of this year. Whats going to happen when they have to refi? It's not like the values consistently declining year over year helps their loan to value at all:

This is wildly stark contrast to residential real estate.

So the problems still cookin, but its not due yet. October or sometime further out there seems more likely to be a time that will mark the top out. Certainly in the near term, people appear scared of these higher prices in the markets. 

Its not like we are even out of the woods on the presidential front either. I just heard Biden legitimatley call Trump his vice president when he was supposed to refer to Kamala Harris. Theres all the legal stuff with Trump being a felon and Biden coming accross as having dementia that is really stirring up the pot. I mean I can't remember a time when a presidents own party was actively advocating for him to not run again so close to the actual election. So all this is new stuff! It's very intersting. I don't care about politics or who wins at all, but I know its going to make for volatility. 

We go out to October, how do people feel about the election then? Theres going to be alot of people who want to be risk off for the outcome of this election. So when are they going to go risk off? It'll be in advance of it. 

In my opinion whoever wins is going to inherit the mess that turns into 2025 (assuming 2024 is basically 2007 and 08 is next year). We already got a bunch of retail  stocks getting nuked out here. LULU and NKE both are getting the business right now and thats a direct window into consumers not buying stuff they don't need anymore. Which can only mean people are becoming more poor. Which  can only mean profits will shrink and future values will have to be revised lower. 

It's all just a cascading domino. I dont know whats going to happen to the banks when CRE blows up or how long that blow up is going to last. Maybe we are due for a multi year pull back or its a nice 12 month 60% decline. Either way Its commin. 

What I will say is that ironically in the past these big bubble bursts see 60% declines. If you price out a 60% decline from our newest all time high of 561.67, you would get 224.67 for SPY. This would place you at pandemic lows. I say this is possible because in my prior posts, You can see how the housing bubble lows actually went to the tech bubble lows. Wild stuff.

This post is a little more about commentary than the data as much hasn't really changed. I still expct a higher all time high. Say SPY got to 600. Well 60% off of that number still places you back to 240. being at 240 is still within the march lows and lower than April 2020's low of 243.90. Why do I like to work backwards for price targets? Sometimes reading the last chapter of a book first, helps you understand your ensuing journey from the 1st chapter.

Probably not 3 in the top 4, but I imagine they would still be ranked pretty high on the list.",measure volatility one way see insane volatility right know points percentage interesting see top intraday point swings history dow within last week would curious see land alltime percentage probably top imagine would still ranked pretty high list,0.12174603174603174,Hold,0.07304761904761904,Sell,0.07029010420134016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18612916707606095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1662423911704226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11917432675214353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1808332688729637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761270939782101,0.0,0.09379181684668468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12964265208786824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12034973462514294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1808332688729637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11583217205951518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42545366612152896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527679888615894,0.14059559581837103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18904839086279934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18904839086279934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527679888615894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3628497431042918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343488269826218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29585412476043244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3005566636697548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15150485140618353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13691397370364244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18339841559398434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22748453530275523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Stocks turned positive Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones shaking yesterday’s losses and the Nasdaq recording a new intraday recor. Market participants continue to weigh rising coronavirus cases in the United States and optimism surrounding a vaccine and additional fiscal stimulus. 

In Washington, lawmakers continue to negotiate in order to agree on measures to fund the government and provide another virus relief package. Lawmakers are poised to vote tomorrow Wednesday on a resolution to push back the deadline to fund the government from this Friday to next week in order to avoid a government shutdown, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. We’ll closely monitor developments in this matter. 

In an effort to support the economy, a bipartisan group of Senators unveiled a new stimulus proposal worth $908 billion, a sum greater than the ceiling Senate Leader Mitch McConnel (Rep.) set but below the Democrat’s original $2 billion proposal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Dem.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Dem.) have indicated they support the proposal and Senator Bill Cassidy (Rep.) told Fox News he is confident the President and Senator McConnell will support the bill. We’ll have to wait and see how it plays out but we do not expect the passage of any stimulus at least until Biden’s administration takes over.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn’t been seen yet. He said, “The blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we’re getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday”. The US is averaging nearly 200,000 infections and 2,237 deaths in the last seven numbers, the deadliest week in the pandemic since late April, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are well over 100,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus. Yesterday, the US recorded around 202,000 new daily infections, 101,487 patients hospitalized, and 1,522 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins Univerisity.

Despite rising cases,  the market is reacting positively to the prospects for widespread vaccine distribution next year and the possibility of additional fiscal stimulus in the US. Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old woman from the United Kingdom, became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outside of the clinical trial. While expectations for growth in 2021 remain high, we expect volatility in the market in the short-term, given the surge in coronavirus cases and the reimposition of restrictions across the nation. California recently placed more than 85% of its residents under stay-at-home order after ICU capacity fell below 15%.

Looking ahead, market participants will continue to eagerly follow developments on the coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to convene its outside scientific advisory board on Thursday to discuss Pfizer’s (PFE) emergency use authorization request for its vaccine. The advisors could vote as soon as that day whether to recommend that the FDA green-light the inoculation and allow the first phase of roll-outs to states. Moderna (MRNA) has also filed an emergency use authorization with the FDA. The FDA is expected to make an announcement about Moderna’s vaccine sometime this week as well. 

**Highlights**

* The FDA says the Pfizer $PFE vaccine meets all safety and success criteria. They are expected to approve the vaccine in the coming days. 
* A QuantumScape executive claimed the company’s new solid-state lithium-metal battery being developed initially developed for electric cars could be powerful enough for use in electric aircraft. The director said, “Electric aviation starts to look a lot more attractive and viable when you have this kind of energy density and power”.
* After falling to the low $20s following Citron’s report, Palantir (PLTR) has mounted a remarkable comeback, back close to $30. Today it was announced the company was awarded a $44.4 million contract by the FDA for data analytics services to speed up review of new medicines, according to a company statement.

1608328273.0,StockMarket,"Daily Market Recap - Friday, December 18, 2020","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 18, 2020**

Stocks fell Friday, one day after the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) recorded new intraday highs. Market participants were disappointed by the weekly unemployment report, which unexpectedly saw new jobless claims rise to the highest level since September, but remain hopeful the grim data will compel lawmakers to pass more virus-related stimulus. 

This Friday marked a quarterly event known as the quadruple witching, during which stock index futures and options, and single equity futures and options, all expire on the same day. This tends to cause trading volumes to spike. This S&P 500 is also set for a major rebalance with the index set to include Tesla, the largest company ever to be added by market cap, in the index by Monday, December 21.

On Thursday, the Labor Department also released its Weekly Unemployment report, which showed a second straight increase in the number of first-time unemployment claims. 880,000 Americans filed for new unemployment claims, much higher than the 818,000 expected. The increase in unemployment is likely a result of the new restrictions being placed throughout the country in response to the recent surge in coronavirus. 

Despite optimistic words from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the possibility of a no-deal scenario and a partial government shutdown is still on the table. Senate Majority Whip John Thune suggested Thursday that the government could go into a partial shutdown over the weekend if lawmakers are unable to agree on the details of both the government spending bill and the virus-relief attached to it. Yesterday, McConnell said, “lawmakers made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic relief” and that “we \[Senators\] have agreed we will not leave town until we’ve made law.” Hopefully, lawmakers are finally able to come together and pass additional and much-needed economic relief.

In good news, more progress was made on the vaccine front after the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) advisory panel voted to recommend that Moderna’s (MRNA) coronavirus vaccine candidate be authorized for emergency use. This would be the second inoculation to be granted emergency use authorization in the US. Pfizer’s (PFE) vaccine has already begun to be distributed across the US.

**Highlights**

* Shares of FedEx (FDX) sank in late trading after the company reported higher costs in its latest quarterly results, as package demand surged to records during the pandemic and onset of the holiday delivery season. Shares of UPS (UPS) fell in sympathy.
* A widespread hack that took advantage of a back door in SolarWinds (SWI) software also affected Microsoft (MSFT). ""Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious Solar Winds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed,"" said Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw said on Twitter (TWTR)
   * Cybersecurity stocks rallied in response to the widespread hack

1737536758.0,StockMarket,Why I Believe Upstart (UPST) Will Soar 40%+ Within the Next 3 Weeks,"**Hey StockMarket,**

**I** believe UPST **COULD** soar within the next 3 weeks. See the breakdown:

**What is UPST?**  
Upstart Holdings (UPST) is an AI-driven lending platform that partners with banks and credit unions to improve loan approvals and pricing. Unlike traditional FICO-based systems, Upstart’s AI analyzes a broader range of factors—like education, employment, and income trends—to provide fairer and more accurate credit assessments. This enables higher loan approval rates, lower default risks, and increased affordability for borrowers, all while benefiting its financial institution partners.

# 1. Consistent Earnings Beats

UPST has consistently delivered **four straight EPS beats**, outperforming expectations every time. Here’s their earnings history:

* **Q3 2024:** EPS of $0.40 (beat estimates by $0.10), revenue of $182M (+15% YoY).
* **Q2 2024:** EPS of $0.35 (beat estimates by $0.08), revenue of $171M (+12% YoY).
* **Q1 2024:** EPS of $0.29 (beat estimates by $0.07), revenue of $165M (+9% YoY).
* **Q4 2023:** EPS of $0.22 (beat estimates by $0.05), revenue of $157M (+8% YoY).

Their next earnings report is scheduled for **2/11/2025**, and analysts expect **EPS of $0.42** and **revenue of $190M**. Given the historical trend of beating estimates, UPST could surprise to the upside again, boosting investor confidence and driving buying activity.

**What happened the last time UPST beat earnings?**  
Following its Q3 2024 earnings beat, UPST surged **20%** in post-earnings trading as investors reacted to strong revenue growth and improving margins. The momentum continued the next day, with the stock opening nearly **18% higher** and gaining another **5% intraday**, fueled by analyst upgrades and short covering. Over just two trading sessions, UPST climbed an impressive **43%**, highlighting its explosive potential after earnings surprises.

**Implications for the upcoming earnings report:**  
If UPST beats expectations again, the combination of high short interest, potential analyst upgrades, and macroeconomic tailwinds could set the stage for another major rally.

# 2. Tailwinds from Rate Cuts

Interest rate cuts are a crucial macroeconomic tailwind for UPST. Here’s why:

* **Federal Reserve's Stance:**
   * The Fed recently cut rates by **25 basis points** and is expected to implement further reductions through **2025** to counter slowing economic growth.
   * Analysts project up to **100 basis points** in total cuts, supporting a favorable environment for lending activity.
* **Market Optimism:**
   * Market participants are pricing in a **66% chance** of additional rate cuts, signaling optimism for lending-focused businesses like UPST.

**Implications for UPST:**

* Lower borrowing costs = increased loan demand.
* UPST’s AI lending model thrives in a low-rate environment by approving more borrowers with competitive terms.
* Their platform can capture refinancing activity as consumers seek to replace high-interest loans.

# 3. Validated AI Model

In a market where many AI models remain untested, UPST’s AI lending platform has demonstrated tangible results:

* **Lower Default Rates:** Independent evaluations show UPST’s AI delivers 43% lower default rates compared to traditional FICO underwriting for borrowers with similar risk profiles.
* **Broader Credit Access:** Approves 27% more borrowers while maintaining or improving risk standards.
* **Cost Savings:** Reduces average APRs by 16%, making loans more affordable for consumers.
* **Resilience:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, UPST’s loan delinquency rates rose by only 6%, compared to 10% for the broader industry.
* **Adoption Growth:** With over 100 financial institutions using its platform and partnerships growing, UPST has demonstrated trust and scalability in the lending industry.

Unlike many unproven AI models, UPST’s technology delivers real-world results, driving borrower satisfaction, lender trust, and shareholder returns.

# 4. Short Interest is High (25% Float)

Short interest in UPST is currently at **\~25% of the float**, which is high enough to raise the potential for a short squeeze.

If UPST delivers an earnings beat, sees a price upgrade from analysts, or experiences any unexpected bullish catalyst, shorts could be forced to cover, leading to accelerated buying pressure.

# 5. Strong Bank Earnings Signal a Robust Sector

Recent earnings reports from major banks highlight the overall strength of the financial sector:

* **JPMorgan Chase:** Reported a 50% increase in net income, reaching over $14 billion in Q4 2024.
* **Morgan Stanley:** Achieved a 51% revenue increase in its equities trading unit in Q4 2024.

While these banks are not direct partners with UPST, their strong performance reflects a healthy banking environment. This indicates robust lending activity and credit demand, which supports UPST’s ability to deliver strong results and exceed EPS expectations.

# 6. Stock Performance and Market Recovery

The current bull market, which began in October 2022, has led to significant gains in major stock indices:

* **S&P 500:** Increased approximately 62% over the past two years.
* **Nasdaq 100:** Rose about 88% in the same period.
* **Dow Jones Industrial Average:** Gained around 46%.

In contrast, UPST's stock has experienced a more volatile trajectory. After reaching an all-time high of $401.49 in October 2021, it declined sharply. However, in 2023, UPST's stock rebounded, surging 209%. Despite this recovery, the stock remains significantly below its peak, indicating that it has not fully participated in the broader market's bull run. This discrepancy suggests that UPST's stock may be undervalued relative to its historical performance and the overall market recovery.

# Risks to Consider

1. **Valuation:** UPST trades at a premium relative to traditional lending companies. Growth execution is critical to justify its valuation.
2. **Macro Uncertainty:** While rate cuts are helpful, broader economic weakness could dampen overall loan demand.
3. **Execution Risk:** They rely heavily on partnerships with banks and credit unions. Slower adoption could impact revenue growth.

1736972495.0,StockMarket,Trading and surfing: 5 steps to building your ideal setup,"Hi all,

I'm a husband, and dad of five, and I've recently transitioned to full time trading.

I wanted to post some concepts that I've found helpful in my trading journey, and in doing so maybe help someone who's thinking of, or working on transitioning to full time trading.

Writing out these concepts has been really helpful for teaching myself different nuances in trading and since I was doing it anyway I thought I'd post it here to potentially help others.

Would also love feedback on my concepts and ideas and to hear about how you guys find the right ""conditions"" for your trading setups.

Here's my post:  
(These are basically notes to myself)

What is a trading “Setup”?

To me, a setup is a set of clear conditions needed to enter and exit a trade.

And to help understand these concepts, I like look at them through the lens of surfing.

Here’s what I mean; Surfers need certain conditions to be met in order to enter the water, paddle out, and consistently catch waves.

Conditions like location of the body of water, time of year, and daily weather patterns all play a part. They also need to consider if the surf spot is crowded, what type of waves they’re trying to catch based on the season, where they will start their wave, and where they’ll exit. They also need to ensure there are safety measures in place.

When combined, these conditions determine the surfers chance of success.

After thousands of attempts that surfer will have a very good understanding of the conditions needed to consistently catch waves. And he will be very specific about those conditions being met in the future, to ensure consistency.

Trading is no different.

# Make it your own.

It’s become clear to me that to be successful over time, every trader must build out their own specific trading conditions that need to be met (trade setups) in order to find trading’s holy grail: consistency.

It’s easy to think setups are best copied from your favorite trader—and yes, this is often a good foundation—but consider a quote from one of my favorite trading authors:

""What if we simply focused on what we understand, what we do well, what makes sense to us?"" – Mike Bellafiore

This makes a lot of sense to me because you are a unique person, with certain traits, talents and abilities. You have individual likes, dislikes, goals, desires, and curiosities.

Just as every surfer is unique, so is every trader. You must eventually carve you’re own path.

I started to get super curious about large and mid-caps on the Nasdaq after I came across traders like Steve Spencer and SMB Capital.

Steve shares examples of how to take advantage of intraday moves in these liquid leaders and I wanted to find more examples—to see how and why people are doing this—so I turned to twitter(X). I questioned and observed how people are thinking about setups in this sector.

The volume and variety of ways people trade is mind-blowing. A clear pattern emerged: each trader developed their own set of conditions through countless trade attempts (reps), staying persistent and learning from their mistakes - making small tweaks along the way with each lesson learned.

“There are no silver bullets, only golden bibi’s” - Unknown

Over time I came to realize this sector of the market was a good place for me to start for several reasons:

1. The (mostly) absent fat-tail risk found in small-cap stocks.
2. The liquidity available to get in and out easily.
3. The variety of ways to leverage trades through things like leveraged ETFs and options.
4. The consistency of moves and catalysts that come from these particular stocks, making them easier to catalogue.
5. Scalability over time.

To help you explore this yourself, I’ll explain five common principles to help you find your conditions. I do this to remind myself and to hopefully support you in building your own setups (conditions) to find consistency.

As you read this post, I encourage you to think about a sector or financial product that has peaked your interest for one reason or another, and what conditions might be needed to suit your needs.

# 5 Principles to creating your own setups

# 1. Narrow your focus - be specific. (What body of water will you surf?)

One common theme I see in all successful traders is being in the right stocks at the right time, and being very specific about it.

A common saying amongst traders - “You’re only as good as the stocks you trade”

Let me explain using the surfing analogy again:  
(I’ll be doing that a lot in this post)

”You’re only as good as the waves you surf”

From careful observation over time, surfers know that the best waves typically happen in Hawaii. Specifically on the north shore of Hawaii.

And just like the surfer, not every trade is worth “paddling out” for. Your job is to find the conditions (a location) where the stocks are moving well and most suited to your abilities. Being in the right place at the right time is everything. Think about it, if you don’t have waves to surf you end up swimming in circles. Trading is no different.

In trading this could be narrowing your focus to large caps with at least a $10 billion market cap and trading at least 1 million shares premarket, and trading them at the open of the trading day when there is the most volume. Or you could look at small cap stocks that have gapped at least 20%. Personally, I like large and mid cap stocks that are trading at least 2-3 times their normal volume in the premarket.

Wherever you focus, the principle is this:

Just like the surfer, you must find a very specific location or sector of the market that is known to consistently produce great trades (waves).

# 2. Stocks are like elastic bands (Are we in the right season for surfing?)

Now that we have our first condition - location - we need to find our specific time frame when the “waves” are at their best.

For surfers, November to February is the prime surfing season in Hawaii.  
It’s when the ocean is most “out of balance” and producing the best waves.

Stocks need to rebalance and find equilibrium, just like the ocean.  
We can often see this imbalance when looking at the price chart (I personally like to start with the daily chart in my search).

The more stretched or compressed a stock is, combined with the amount of time it remains in that state, the greater the probability of an outsized move is coming (wave to surf).

Just as surfers recognize certain patterns in the seasons, traders start to recognize patterns in the price charts that show them when a stock is out of balance and whether it’s in the right “season” for trading.

Check out the example below. Here’s a stock that looks out of balance to me and that I think was ready for a wave:

https://preview.redd.it/gauvnirgu7de1.png?width=2551&format=png&auto=webp&s=93618fc78414fd2df5e6c5b4a5e7d1053d6a509b

Nvidia had been building pressure (compressed) for two months. Instead of heading back down, it paused mid-channel, making a “higher low” and started pushing up to the upper level of the trend. The pressure that was building released, and it broke out to the previous high from the candle on the far left. This change in price action (for me it was the higher low) signals it was time to get interested and dig a bit deeper.

Surf’s up!

# 3. Catalysts are key to finding consistency (What’s the weather like today?)

Think about the conditions we have so far:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)

For our third condition, we’re talking about catalysts (think weather on the day)...

In the case of a surfer, they’re observing if the day’s weather conditions match with the location and time of season. If they’re in Hawaii > on the north shore > in January > they know from hard-won experience that the perfect weather includes the following:

* Big Swells: January is part of Hawaii's peak surf season, with large swells generated by winter storms in the North Pacific. Wave heights typically range from 6-20+ feet, depending on the spot (e.g., Pipeline, Sunset Beach, or Waimea Bay).
* Clean Surf: Ideal conditions have minimal wind or light offshore winds (blowing from the land to the sea), which keep the waves clean and well-shaped.
* Swell Direction :A west-northwest to northwest swell direction is optimal for the North Shore, as it aligns well with most surf breaks.
* Mild Air Temperatures: Daytime highs: 75–80°F (24–27°C).Nighttime lows: Around 65–70°F (18–21°C).
* Sunny or Partly Cloudy Skies: Clear weather enhances visibility and comfort.
* Gentle Winds: Trade winds (northeast) are common but should be light to avoid choppy surf. Ideal wind speeds: 5–10 mph (8–16 km/h).
* Water Temperature: Around 75°F (24°C), so a light wetsuit top or rash guard is usually sufficient, but many surfers go without.
* Tide: Tide timing depends on the specific break, but mid to high tide is often preferred for safer and more consistent waves.

Think about how specific that is!  
Now let’s take that principle over to trading.

In the example of Nvidia, the main catalyst was technical (based mostly on the chart pattern). The stock’s daily price action had been compressed for a meaningful amount of time, it then started to deviate and move up on volume, to what I deemed as a very key level. Showing me it was potentially ready to change. This (along with a few other variables that are unique to my needs) confirmed it met my conditions for a potential trade on the day.

The “weather” looked good!

Catalysts can of course be non-technical. They can include fresh news, downgrades, upgrades, or surprise earnings reports. These can all be great reasons to enter a trade.

For example, if the market expects $1 per share in earnings, but the company delivers $1.20—especially from a new revenue stream—it can spark a powerful move.

For the surfer, the weather conditions need to match up with the location and season in order to create good waves.

For the trader, the best catalysts will nearly always match up with the first two conditions; location (stock) and time of season (daily pattern).

With thousands of reps, just as it becomes second nature to a seasoned surfer, the same is true for the experienced trader.

Tip: In the early stages of your trading career, just like a young surfer, be specific and write out every nuance you notice when you see big trades (waves). It could be things like what the volume is doing, what’s the sector doing, how it’s acting in the premarket or around certain key levels, what’s the open interest in the option chains, are there big buyers or sellers on the tape? etc. This gives you more data to cross reference over time and allows you to gain experience faster. Don’t forget to record your screen so you can replay the trades! Upload your recordings to YouTube and set them to private for easy reference.

# 4. Volume (Now we’re in the water, waiting for the wave)

We now have a very solid base of conditions to build on. So far our principles include:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)
3. Catalyst (weather conditions of the day).

Now let’s talk about the fourth principle: Volume (how many shares are being bought and sold in a certain time frame).

Volume flows give you a sense of the probabilities of the expected move actually taking place.

Again, think of it like a surfer waiting for the next wave; they might have perfect conditions on the day, they just need some confirmation…

They may see a rising bump or swell line on the horizon. This indicates an incoming wave. Surfers look for sets (groups of waves) and gauge the wave's size and speed from its appearance far out at sea.

Traders can do the same with volume!

For example: Is the volume increasing or slowing? Is it more than normal for this stock, sector, or time of day? By how much? Is it spiking or constant?

If the volume looks like it’s aligning with your conditions, it’s time to focus.

The wave is coming…

Now one last piece of the puzzle remains.

# 5. Price action (Wait for your signal to enter)

We’re in the water, waiting…Conditions are perfect.

We have our conditions set:

1. Stock (location) ✓
2. Daily pattern (time of season) ✓
3. Catalyst (weather on the day) ✓
4. Volume (water rises on the horizon) ✓

The final piece to the puzzle is price action…

You have a plan in place, you know what you want to see, you just need to wait to see it.

In trading, price action can include things like candlestick patterns, tape reading (one of my favorites), price behavior around certain key levels or indicators, bid and offer sizing on the level II, and many other nuances that simply take time and reps to recognize.

Price action is everything in trading.

It’s the final piece that tells you if it’s go time (or not).

I personally love it because feedback is almost instantaneous.  
Some traders call it the “only truth” in trading.

In surfing I liken it to when you see the white water at the tip of a wave starting to crest, the waves are starting to move faster and break to shore according your angle. This is exactly what you want to see - all signaling your entry.

Time to start paddling.

And depending on the conditions, how hard to paddle. (think position sizing - but more on that later. Right now we just need to practice standing up.)

You’re paddling, you’re feeling the wave starting. You stand up on your board, set your sights on managing your ride, and simply follow your plan to the exit.

All your focus is now on the price action during your trade.

Just as a surfer is watching the wave he’s riding - looking at its curve and shape, its speed, size and watching out for dangers along the way - so is the trader.

You have a plan in place in case you see different variables pop up. But otherwise you’re simply riding the trade, taking the rep and riding as long as you can, or until you get to your target.

Just like surfing, price action in trading is best learned through experience.  
The more you do it, the more nuances you pick up and the more confident you become.

# Bonus principle: Film your surf session, take notes!

In both surfing and trading, reviewing your performance is essential for improvement. Just as a surfer might film their sessions to analyze technique, you can track and review your trades to identify patterns, strengths, and areas for growth.

Journaling your setups, entry and exit points, and emotional state during trades can provide invaluable insights over time. The goal is to iterate—refining your strategy with each trade (wave) to consistently improve your edge and execution.

I hope these principles can help guide as you build out your own unique conditions to become a more consistent and profitable trader.",9,2,"Trading and surfing: 5 steps to building your ideal setup Hi all,

It’s become clear to me that to be successful over time, every trader must build out their own specific trading conditions that need to be met (trade setups) in order to find trading’s holy grail: consistency.

It’s easy to think setups are best copied from your favorite trader—and yes, this is often a good foundation—but consider a quote from one of my favorite trading authors:

""What if we simply focused on what we understand, what we do well, what makes sense to us?"" – Mike Bellafiore

This makes a lot of sense to me because you are a unique person, with certain traits, talents and abilities. You have individual likes, dislikes, goals, desires, and curiosities.

Just as every surfer is unique, so is every trader. You must eventually carve you’re own path.

I started to get super curious about large and mid-caps on the Nasdaq after I came across traders like Steve Spencer and SMB Capital.

Steve shares examples of how to take advantage of intraday moves in these liquid leaders and I wanted to find more examples—to see how and why people are doing this—so I turned to twitter(X). I questioned and observed how people are thinking about setups in this sector.

The volume and variety of ways people trade is mind-blowing. A clear pattern emerged: each trader developed their own set of conditions through countless trade attempts (reps), staying persistent and learning from their mistakes - making small tweaks along the way with each lesson learned.

Over time I came to realize this sector of the market was a good place for me to start for several reasons:

1. The (mostly) absent fat-tail risk found in small-cap stocks.
2. The liquidity available to get in and out easily.
3. The variety of ways to leverage trades through things like leveraged ETFs and options.
4. The consistency of moves and catalysts that come from these particular stocks, making them easier to catalogue.
5. Scalability over time.

To help you explore this yourself, I’ll explain five common principles to help you find your conditions. I do this to remind myself and to hopefully support you in building your own setups (conditions) to find consistency.

As you read this post, I encourage you to think about a sector or financial product that has peaked your interest for one reason or another, and what conditions might be needed to suit your needs.

# 5 Principles to creating your own setups

# 1. Narrow your focus - be specific. (What body of water will you surf?)

One common theme I see in all successful traders is being in the right stocks at the right time, and being very specific about it.

A common saying amongst traders - “You’re only as good as the stocks you trade”

Let me explain using the surfing analogy again:  
(I’ll be doing that a lot in this post)

”You’re only as good as the waves you surf”

From careful observation over time, surfers know that the best waves typically happen in Hawaii. Specifically on the north shore of Hawaii.

And just like the surfer, not every trade is worth “paddling out” for. Your job is to find the conditions (a location) where the stocks are moving well and most suited to your abilities. Being in the right place at the right time is everything. Think about it, if you don’t have waves to surf you end up swimming in circles. Trading is no different.

In trading this could be narrowing your focus to large caps with at least a $10 billion market cap and trading at least 1 million shares premarket, and trading them at the open of the trading day when there is the most volume. Or you could look at small cap stocks that have gapped at least 20%. Personally, I like large and mid cap stocks that are trading at least 2-3 times their normal volume in the premarket.

Wherever you focus, the principle is this:

Just like the surfer, you must find a very specific location or sector of the market that is known to consistently produce great trades (waves).

# 2. Stocks are like elastic bands (Are we in the right season for surfing?)

Now that we have our first condition - location - we need to find our specific time frame when the “waves” are at their best.

For surfers, November to February is the prime surfing season in Hawaii.  
It’s when the ocean is most “out of balance” and producing the best waves.

Stocks need to rebalance and find equilibrium, just like the ocean.  
We can often see this imbalance when looking at the price chart (I personally like to start with the daily chart in my search).

The more stretched or compressed a stock is, combined with the amount of time it remains in that state, the greater the probability of an outsized move is coming (wave to surf).

Just as surfers recognize certain patterns in the seasons, traders start to recognize patterns in the price charts that show them when a stock is out of balance and whether it’s in the right “season” for trading.

Check out the example below. Here’s a stock that looks out of balance to me and that I think was ready for a wave:

Nvidia had been building pressure (compressed) for two months. Instead of heading back down, it paused mid-channel, making a “higher low” and started pushing up to the upper level of the trend. The pressure that was building released, and it broke out to the previous high from the candle on the far left. This change in price action (for me it was the higher low) signals it was time to get interested and dig a bit deeper.

Surf’s up!

# 3. Catalysts are key to finding consistency (What’s the weather like today?)

Think about the conditions we have so far:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)

For our third condition, we’re talking about catalysts (think weather on the day)...

In the case of a surfer, they’re observing if the day’s weather conditions match with the location and time of season. If they’re in Hawaii > on the north shore > in January > they know from hard-won experience that the perfect weather includes the following:

* Big Swells: January is part of Hawaii's peak surf season, with large swells generated by winter storms in the North Pacific. Wave heights typically range from 6-20+ feet, depending on the spot (e.g., Pipeline, Sunset Beach, or Waimea Bay).
* Clean Surf: Ideal conditions have minimal wind or light offshore winds (blowing from the land to the sea), which keep the waves clean and well-shaped.
* Swell Direction :A west-northwest to northwest swell direction is optimal for the North Shore, as it aligns well with most surf breaks.
* Mild Air Temperatures: Daytime highs: 75–80°F (24–27°C).Nighttime lows: Around 65–70°F (18–21°C).
* Sunny or Partly Cloudy Skies: Clear weather enhances visibility and comfort.
* Gentle Winds: Trade winds (northeast) are common but should be light to avoid choppy surf. Ideal wind speeds: 5–10 mph (8–16 km/h).
* Water Temperature: Around 75°F (24°C), so a light wetsuit top or rash guard is usually sufficient, but many surfers go without.
* Tide: Tide timing depends on the specific break, but mid to high tide is often preferred for safer and more consistent waves.

Think about how specific that is!  
Now let’s take that principle over to trading.

In the example of Nvidia, the main catalyst was technical (based mostly on the chart pattern). The stock’s daily price action had been compressed for a meaningful amount of time, it then started to deviate and move up on volume, to what I deemed as a very key level. Showing me it was potentially ready to change. This (along with a few other variables that are unique to my needs) confirmed it met my conditions for a potential trade on the day.

The “weather” looked good!

Catalysts can of course be non-technical. They can include fresh news, downgrades, upgrades, or surprise earnings reports. These can all be great reasons to enter a trade.

For example, if the market expects $1 per share in earnings, but the company delivers $1.20—especially from a new revenue stream—it can spark a powerful move.

For the surfer, the weather conditions need to match up with the location and season in order to create good waves.

For the trader, the best catalysts will nearly always match up with the first two conditions; location (stock) and time of season (daily pattern).

With thousands of reps, just as it becomes second nature to a seasoned surfer, the same is true for the experienced trader.

Tip: In the early stages of your trading career, just like a young surfer, be specific and write out every nuance you notice when you see big trades (waves). It could be things like what the volume is doing, what’s the sector doing, how it’s acting in the premarket or around certain key levels, what’s the open interest in the option chains, are there big buyers or sellers on the tape? etc. This gives you more data to cross reference over time and allows you to gain experience faster. Don’t forget to record your screen so you can replay the trades! Upload your recordings to YouTube and set them to private for easy reference.

# 4. Volume (Now we’re in the water, waiting for the wave)

We now have a very solid base of conditions to build on. So far our principles include:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)
3. Catalyst (weather conditions of the day).

Now let’s talk about the fourth principle: Volume (how many shares are being bought and sold in a certain time frame).

Volume flows give you a sense of the probabilities of the expected move actually taking place.

Again, think of it like a surfer waiting for the next wave; they might have perfect conditions on the day, they just need some confirmation…

They may see a rising bump or swell line on the horizon. This indicates an incoming wave. Surfers look for sets (groups of waves) and gauge the wave's size and speed from its appearance far out at sea.

Traders can do the same with volume!

For example: Is the volume increasing or slowing? Is it more than normal for this stock, sector, or time of day? By how much? Is it spiking or constant?

If the volume looks like it’s aligning with your conditions, it’s time to focus.

The wave is coming…

Now one last piece of the puzzle remains.

# 5. Price action (Wait for your signal to enter)

We’re in the water, waiting…Conditions are perfect.

We have our conditions set:

1. Stock (location) ✓
2. Daily pattern (time of season) ✓
3. Catalyst (weather on the day) ✓
4. Volume (water rises on the horizon) ✓

The final piece to the puzzle is price action…

You have a plan in place, you know what you want to see, you just need to wait to see it.

In trading, price action can include things like candlestick patterns, tape reading (one of my favorites), price behavior around certain key levels or indicators, bid and offer sizing on the level II, and many other nuances that simply take time and reps to recognize.

Price action is everything in trading.

It’s the final piece that tells you if it’s go time (or not).

I personally love it because feedback is almost instantaneous.  
Some traders call it the “only truth” in trading.

In surfing I liken it to when you see the white water at the tip of a wave starting to crest, the waves are starting to move faster and break to shore according your angle. This is exactly what you want to see - all signaling your entry.

Time to start paddling.

And depending on the conditions, how hard to paddle. (think position sizing - but more on that later. Right now we just need to practice standing up.)

You’re paddling, you’re feeling the wave starting. You stand up on your board, set your sights on managing your ride, and simply follow your plan to the exit.

All your focus is now on the price action during your trade.

Just as a surfer is watching the wave he’s riding - looking at its curve and shape, its speed, size and watching out for dangers along the way - so is the trader.

You have a plan in place in case you see different variables pop up. But otherwise you’re simply riding the trade, taking the rep and riding as long as you can, or until you get to your target.

Just like surfing, price action in trading is best learned through experience.  
The more you do it, the more nuances you pick up and the more confident you become.

# Bonus principle: Film your surf session, take notes!

In both surfing and trading, reviewing your performance is essential for improvement. Just as a surfer might film their sessions to analyze technique, you can track and review your trades to identify patterns, strengths, and areas for growth.

Journaling your setups, entry and exit points, and emotional state during trades can provide invaluable insights over time. The goal is to iterate—refining your strategy with each trade (wave) to consistently improve your edge and execution.

I hope these principles can help guide as you build out your own unique conditions to become a more consistent and profitable trader.",trading surfing steps building ideal setup hi im husband dad five

1660912131.0,StockMarket,Ryan Cohen Sold His Entire BBBY Shares and Options: Do you think it was a pump and dump?,"Meme stock influencer Ryan Cohen is sending Bed Bath & Beyond stock plummeting.

Shares of the badly struggling retailer cratered 45% in pre-market trading on Friday as it was disclosed late Thursday Cohen's RC Ventures sold his entire position in Bed Bath & Beyond. Cohen, who is also the chairman of GameStop, had about an 11.8% stake in the company.

Cohen's exit caps off an otherwise insane week of trading for a retailer not too far away from entering a grave alongside Sears, Kmart, Borders, and Circuit City.

Bed Bath & Beyond stock skyrocketed by nearly 70% in intraday trading on Tuesday as a result of a massive short squeeze. BBBY stock finished that session up 29% in a volatile day. From Tuesday's close to prior to Cohen's disclosure after Thursday's session, shares had gained another 17%.

Cohen initially disclosed a 9.8% stake in the company in March, and the recent resurgence of BBBY stock involved the meme community once again rallying together to counter institutional forces that hold opposing views on the stock and the underlying business.

On Monday, Yahoo Finance reported on signs of financial stress at Bed Bath & Beyond locations in New York — and received colorful feedback from BBBY fans. On Tuesday, B Riley slashed its rating to Sell on Bed Bath & Beyond. Analysts at UBS and Wedbush also reiterated their sell ratings on the stock this week.

But with Cohen now out of the picture, the market may turn back to focusing on Bed Bath & Beyond's bleak near-term outlook.

And, as we've previously reported, it's brutal.

After a failed push in 2021 and most of 2022 into stocking stores with private label goods no one had heard of while also closing stores and firing workers, Bed Bath & Beyond ended its most recent quarter with a little more than $100 million in cash, tanking sales, weak store traffic, and a badly damaged brand.

There is currently an interim CEO running the business, which came about after the booting of former top Target exec Mark Tritton, and some observers are wondering whether vendors will continue to ship all of the merchandise that Bed Bath & Beyond needs for the holiday season amid the retailer's severely weakened financial state.

1720205947.0,StockMarket,Massive tracking error for International ETFs,"While doing some research, I realized that I'm seeing sort of a tracking error for international ETFs. Here's my analysis for an Indian stock market index, accounting for exchange rate changes:

* INDY, a US-listed ETF that tracks the NIFTY 50 index in India, grew 40% in the past 5 years. If you had invested $100 in INDY 5 years ago, it would be $140 by now.
* Meanwhile, NIFTY 50 grew by 2x in the same time. USD:INR exchange rate went from 68.84 to 83.37 in the same period. Meaning if you had sent that $100 to India and invested in a Nifty 50 index fund domiciled in India, it would have grown from INR 6884 to INR 13688. Which converted back to USD (13688 / 83.37) is $165.

Could somebody help me understand this? How could there be a tracking error of this magnitude? Could be one of the reasons why funds like VXUS have been so performing so poorly over the life of the fund?",9,16,"Massive tracking error for International ETFs While doing some research, I realized that I'm seeing sort of a tracking error for international ETFs.

1719671984.0,StockMarket,Nike - Opportunity for the dividend portfolio?,"Nike has a strong dividend history and currently pays an annual dividend of $1.48 per share, which equates to a dividend yield of around 1.5%. The company has raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years and plans to continue this tradition, indicating solid financial health and sustainable growth.

The trick now, of course, is to find the right entry point into the market. I help myself with a chart on a weekly basis, which currently offers the possibility of a wolf's mouth. A wolf's mouth consists of 5 pattern points, and the lines represent the signal and target areas of the price movement. For a signal in a wolf mouth, the lower yellow line must be broken, and then the signal line must be penetrated again from bottom to top in a reversal, in our case. 

In this situation, it is important to pay attention to the chart's behavior. If the price bounces off the signal line (1-3) from below, a rapid continuation of the previous short movement is to be expected. Similarly, if we penetrate the wolf, price targets up to at least the open gap or the target line (1-4) are realistic, providing a confident outlook on the potential outcomes.

A harmonic pattern can be used in the chart to limit the current downward movement. In our scenario, we use a butterfly pattern. It is particularly essential to look at this in combination. Remember that the situation at the wolf trigger is crucial.  We can, therefore, try to confirm this Harmonic pattern by penetrating or bouncing off the signal line of the wolf. If the butterfly pattern starts, we can use another Fibonacci from the harmonic pattern points A to D to forecast the starting points of the suspected movement.

After the situation at the signal line of the wolf, you have to take care of a stop loss. I also use the rules of technical analysis here. I use the Elliott wave correction rule for wave 2, which states that the path of wave 2 may correct a maximum of 99.99% of the movement of wave 1.

https://preview.redd.it/y3k6h37hri9d1.png?width=3624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d9ace2b472549a3a15c83da3e7e45f6c044b2cb

The point of the whole scenario is to find a safe entry that can quickly the Stop Loss set to break even. Just so you know, I am an active day trader and trade very actively, which means you must maintain the trade. Likewise, I am aware that if an experienced Elliott Waver colleague sees this chart, he will point out to me that the short target after the Elliott waves is much higher. This has to do with the fact that an Elliott wave 3 has to run at least the 161 Fibonacci extension. I am aware of this, but as I said, the strategy is to find Hedgeable entries without messing up the equity and drawdown value in the account. I always care not to lose anything in my trading style, so I always break even quickly. The account grows via the trading frequency and partial sales, and when the price runs through, there is a significant and profitable rebound as the cherry on the sundae. By combining these three completely different strategies, good insights and deductions with a certain logic can be derived, which only sometimes works for me too. But it's better than shooting blindly into the air. The next step is checking various indicators. One Rule of Elliott waves is that a divergence should accompany a C correction wave. This Rule is essential because, as you already know, wave two may correct a maximum of 99.99%. Of course, we also need to ensure that the fundamental conditions for a correction are in place, which is the case here.

Even if they are often dismissed as inferior, I always recommend taking a look at the moving averages. In our scenario, the picture of the moving averages in the weekly time frame is fundamentally against us. Even if you scroll back up to the previous chart, you will see that there is currently no significant divergence at the current price level. 

https://preview.redd.it/2dn6o5orri9d1.png?width=3666&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d708a8c2131fa426ebad4fcc446f83a69507c16

The indicative chart, therefore, initially speaks against the structural trade setup. Still, looking at it from the perspective that we are looking for a Hedgeable entry, a retest of the moving averages can appear quite plausible. If we count back 50 candles from the blue moving average, it should rise in the near future. Consider the area of the Harmonic Butterfly Pattern between the pattern points B-C.

If we now do the same with the 200 moving average in red, we can see that it is in the falling phase, which means that the line of the 200 moving average should fall. The current strong falling candle has the appearance of a so-called Marubozu candle, which also goes against our idea. Marubozu candles do not have a significant trading range and consist only of the candle's body.

You may remember what we talked about at the beginning of this post, it was about the wolf. We need to determine how the price behaves at the signal line. In practice, after the signal line is broken, an intraday timeframe is used to refine the entry. I use a Multitimeframe principle for this, which would go beyond the scope of this article. However, if you are interested, I can write a separate article when the opportunity arises.

1696518137.0,StockMarket,Any historical companies like big tech?,"Hi all, I'm trying to win a debate here.

I am all for passive ETF investing while my friend thinks that he can pick exceptionally performing stocks easily and thinks he can continue to earn a tidy profit by investing in Apple or Tesla.

So my understanding is it's difficult to accurate pick stocks for laymen like us. But besides that, I want to know if there were any companies in history where everyone thought the stock price will just keep going up and up and nobody could have thought the prices will dip and eventually it did and never recovered?

And also, what are you opinions on whether the current set of big tech firms that seems so invincible now, will they go down that path?

1682413677.0,StockMarket,The stock market is unusually quiet right now.,"* By multiple measures, the stock market is the calmest it's been since the end of 2021.
* JPMorgan quant guru Marko Kolanovic says the equity market is far too placid right now, considering all the headwinds it's facing.
* He says technical factors are suppressing volatility in the face of rising rates, credit tightening, and macro risks.

The stock market is awfully quiet right now. Perhaps too quiet.

Price swings are muted no matter how you look at them. On a forward 30-day basis — something measured by the VIX, which is commonly referred to as the stock market's fear gauge — traders are expecting the lowest volatility in more than two years. On an actual realized basis, the past 30 days have also been the most placid since 2021.

That calm stands in stark contrast to all the headwinds currently swirling. One major force is rising interest rates, which have been consistently hiked by the Federal Reserve for more than a year in an attempt to cool inflation. Yes, inflation has come down, but the central bank has yet to signal it's ready to pump the brakes.

Those rising rates have led to a tightening of credit availability, a dynamic reinforced by recent banking-system turmoil. There's also the ever-looming geopolitical overhang of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the widespread impact it's had on energy and foreign-exchange markets.

The chart below shows just how range-bound markets have been so far in 2023, relative to the second half of 2022. While multiple asset classes match up closely with their prior range, none does so more than equities.

Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan's chief market strategist and co-head of global research, agrees with anyone who says the forces outlined above *should* be roiling markets. The fact that they're not, he says, boils down to temporary technical factors. Once those are removed, watch out.

Kolanovic specifically references the dominance of option sellers, whose activity he says drives intraday stock-price reversions, which naturally leads to flat trading for the overall market. That subdued volatility then prompts mechanical buyers — like volatility-targeting and risk-parity funds — to add exposure. The net result is a market that seems strangely unbothered by negative headwinds. (For context, the VIX generally trades inverse to the S&P 500, so gains in stocks are usually accompanied by a low VIX reading.)

""This market dynamic artificially suppresses perceptions of macro fundamental risk,"" Kolanovic wrote in a new client note on Monday.

The key word there is ""artificially,"" which conveys the unsustainable nature of the market's current placidity.

Kolanovic took his commentary a step further and offered a recommendation for further rallies in stocks: as soon as you see a bounce, hit the sell button and take some profits.

""Robust fundamentals bode well for 1Q earnings results, but we advise using any market strength on reporting to reduce exposure,"" he concluded.",48,34,"The stock market is unusually quiet right now. * By multiple measures, the stock market is the calmest it's been since the end of 2021.

1612374826.0,StockMarket,END OF DAY TADING REMINDER FOR NEWBIES,"Some day traders will trade the last hour of the day, from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. By that time, traders have had a long break since the morning session, allowing them to regroup and regain their focus. 

The last hour can be a lot like the first when you're looking at common intraday patterns. It's full of bigger moves and sharp reversals. Like the first hour, many amateur traders jump in during the last hour, buying or selling based on what has happened so far that day. Dumb money is once again floating around, although not as much as in the morning. It's ready to be scooped up by more experienced money managers and day traders. End of day trading is also usually dominated by the big boys, and people who lost in the morning but are trying to make up for it.. this can be good and bad for retail traders. while you do see big moves, a lot of people quickly learn that this time of day increases risk significantly. if you tend to trade impulsively or without fantastic resources, you should avoid trading late in the day, and stick to trading OPEN-NOON. This way you have the rest of the day to make up for any potential losses

**SIDE-NOTE:** Tip to all newbies making large trades; you start trading to make money.. and with that goal comes unavoidable risk and loss. a great way to reduce losses is to sell 50% of your position (or what amount is adequate) to cover 50% of your original investment. Never dive into a trade without doing your research first. Trade what you know. Have an exit strategy.

Stocks once again traded very choppily, with the market pulling back before reversing intraday to finish mixed. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around stimulus talks, rising coronavirus infections, and the final presidential debate last night. 

The S&P 500 (SPY) performed the best today, finishing the day 0.29% up. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.2%, and the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell a modest 0.11%.

It appears almost certain that there will not be additional stimulus before the November election, a mere eleven days away. House Speaker Pelosi still thinks it’s possible for a bill to pass before the election, but says it’s up to President Trump. She said, “We put pen to paper… we are writing the bill, and hopefully we will be able to resolve it… we could do that before the election if the president wants to.” Any additional stimulus will likely include a new round of checks and more money for unemployment benefits, schools, state, and local governments. 

This morning, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg TV that “the ball’s not really moving much right now” in discussions, and that he “doesn’t want to make any predictions about the timing of an agreement.”

Unfortunately, in the US, around 71,600 new cases were recorded yesterday, according to data from John Hopkins. According to CBS News that is the fourth-highest number of new infections reported in the country since the pandemic began and the highest number reported since July. During the debate candidate Joe Biden warned of a “dark winter coming” and once again urged the public to wear masks and follow federal social distancing guidelines. President Trump, on the other hand, incorrectly claimed that the virus was “going away” and that the US is “rounding the corner.” These statements were meant with severe criticism from health officials and are simply not true from a number’s perspective, the country is averaging more than 50,000 new infections a day and it appears to be climbing.

In Europe, governments and health officials are scrambling to deal with a surge of infections across the continent, with many fearing a second wave. Millions across Europe are now facing tougher coronavirus restrictions. Italy, France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere are introducing curfews in large regions of the country in a bid to stem the recent spike in cases. In England, the government has imposed restrictions in the capital of London and in cities in the Northern parts of the country.

**Highlights**

* Intel (INTC) sold off more than 10% after the company unexpectedly posted a quarterly decline in data center chip sales, driven by a near-halving of revenue from enterprise and government clients during the pandemic.
* Today, remdesivir, Gilead’s (GILD) antiviral treatment, became the first drug to receive formal approval by the FDA to treat Covid-19. The drug was used as part of President Trump’s treatment after his diagnosis earlier this month.
* Tesla (TSLA) plans to recall more than 29,000 of its Model S and Model X vehicles from China after problems with the cars' front and rear suspension were discovered.
* Wells Fargo (WFC) is reportedly planning to sell its asset management business for around $3 billion.
* AstraZeneca (AZN) reported that its COVID-19 vaccine trial will resume in the U.S. The Phase 3 clinical trial for the vaccine candidate that the company is developing with the University of Oxford was placed on hold in multiple countries over concern about an unexplained illness. The trial has already been restarted in the U.K.
* Remark Holdings (MARK) jumped 39% in late-afternoon trading on Friday after the company tweeted that for the first time, the company is selling its technologies in partnership with Intel (INTC)
* Joe Biden's remarks Thursday that he would seek to phase out oil stoked concerns among some oil and gas executives that a Democratic administration would further weigh down an industry hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.     
* Salesforce.com (CRM) had a price target raised by Barclays from $264 to $315 at OVERWEIGHT. The stock is at $250 so implies a 25% upside! Very bullish call
* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raised by Barclays from $126 to $136 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock is at $102 so a 33% upside implied.
* Discover Financial Services (DFS) had a price target raised by Deutsche Bank from $55 to $74 at HOLD, by Royal Bank of Canada from $61 to $75 at OUTPERFORM, and by BMO Capital from $76 to $80 at OUTPERFORM.

The following raised price targets: Raymond James from $45 to $49 at STRONG BUY, Credit Suisse from $46 to $51 at OUTPERFORM, Cowen from $43 to $46 at OUTPERFORM, UBS Group from $48 to $52, and Morgan Stanley the most bullish from $56 to $59 at OVERWEIGHT. This chart looks so good! Believe there's an opportunity here.
* Service Now (NOW) received a price target raised from $465 to $560 and from POSITIVE to OUTPERFORM. We really like this one, and its chart currently!
* Microsoft (MSFT) received a price target raise from Barclays from $234 to $249 at OVERWEIGHT. We like this one.
* The Boston Beer (SAM) has been nothing short of spectacular this year! Had a price target raised by Deutsche Bank from $835 to $996 at HOLD, and Smith Barney Citigroup raised target from $1,015 to $1,150. This is a crazy one as analysts can't seem to keep up with the stock!
* Slack Technologies (WORK) received a price target raise from Barclays from $31 to $36 at OVERWEIGHT. The stock is at $28 so implies a 25% upside.

Hey y'all!

Most of you guys know me but if not my name is Chris aka @ckz8780 on Twitter and I'm a full time trader and run Greenbar Trading, my company, which is focused on stock market education. In the past I've posted my stock picks here in /r/stockmarket and lots of people have made money off them and I've always gotten tons of great feedback so I wanted to do something to give back to the Reddit community for being so welcoming and letting me blabber about my picks, myself and my services on here so I could grow both my trading and my business. Without Reddit I wouldn't be where I am. Now, I constantly get PMs and questions about what tools I use and the truth is there are literally hundreds of tools that you can use but having a good solid list of websites and tools is essential to doing accurate market research, picking the right stocks and then actually being able to trade them. So I am going to go through my list of hundreds of bookmarks and tools that I have here on this computer and share all the best ones I know and what I use them for. I won't add to this list unless it is a tool I use regularly because I only want to recommend stuff I have used personally and found to be successful, but definitely feel free to post your own favorites in the replies to make this list even bigger. I'm going to personally stay away from all the standard stuff like The Intelligent Investor, Investopedia, etc. Those are great but this is stuff I actually use practically every single day. If you want to learn how to trade from scratch then send me a PM and I can point you in the right direction. Ok, in no particular order of preference, here we go!

**TRADING SOFTWARE/BROKERS:**

* [Suretrader](http://www.suretrader.com): My main broker. Great shorts and no pattern day trading rule.
* [Tradestation](http://www.tradestation.com): Another broker I use heavily. Amazing software but retail so you have to maintain $25k to day trade. One of the most powerful scanners in the business using EasyLanguage.
* [Thinkorswim](http://www.thinkorswim.com): TD Ameritrade's ""Professional"" software. It's a bit buggy and slow and they sell your order flow so executions suck for day trading, but the charting is pretty nice and they have a decent scanner. Also it's one of the only platforms I really like for paper trading, though Tradestation is also really nice for that.
* [Scottrade Elite](http://www.scottrade.com): Scottrade's ""professional"" software. Not bad if you're doing more advanced swing trading. Fills and executions are surprisingly good for a retail broker. Also they will bundle TradeIdeas (an awesome intraday scanner) for like $10/month.
* [FreeStockCharts](http://www.freestockcharts.com): The best free charting software out there. If you are not advanced enough to be using the trading software above but the charts on Google Finance and Yahoo Finance aren't good enough for you, this is your answer.
* [TradingView](http://www.tradingview.com): Another good (and free!) chart site if you don't have pro trading software.

**SCANNERS/SCREENERS:**

* [StockFetcher](http://www.stockfetcher.com): The best bang for the buck hands down when it comes to scanning. Very powerful and easy to code. I use it literally every single day and it's cheaper than Netflix!
* [Finviz Screener](http://www.finviz.com/screener.ashx): Great for screening stocks with all kinds of characteristics from descriptive to fundamental to technical. Screens can be saved 
* [StockMarketWatch Screener](http://thestockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/today.aspx): Nice scan I run each morning to find the stocks that are gapping up/down the most. These will be the ones in play for that day. Combining this with Finviz I can throw all the gappers into Finviz and check the news on them quickly and easily.
* [Google Finance Screener](https://www.google.com/finance/stockscreener): Similar to Finviz's screener but allows you to screen on some different stuff like [float](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/091004.asp) which Finviz doesn't allow. 
* [StockCharts Predefined Scans](http://stockcharts.com/def/servlet/SC.scan): Great list of predefined scans for generating trading ideas. 

**USEFUL WEBSITES:**

* [StreetInsider Earnings Insider](http://www.streetinsider.com/portal/Earnings+Insider/5.html): Great for quickly determining if a company met, beat or missed earnings, what their consensus was, and what their guidance was. Also provides next expected EPS date.
* [Zacks Earnings](http://www.zacks.com): Just type the ticker into the quote box in the upper right and look under the ""key earnings data"" section to find the next earnings date. I've found Zacks' dates to be the most accurate over many years of trading.
* [ETF Replay](http://www.etfreplay.com/summary/1.aspx): Great summary of ETF performance for gauging sector performance and finding strength when all seems weak, weakness when all seems strong. 
* [Finviz ETF Maps](http://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=etf): Same as above.
* [Bespoke ETF Cheat Sheets](http://www.bespokeinvest.com/thinkbig/2012/7/30/bespokes-full-line-of-etf-cheat-sheets.html): Looking for an ETF that relates to what you're trading? Check out these cheat sheets for ideas.
* [Yahoo Finance Sector List](http://biz.yahoo.com/p/s_peeu.html): List of all **sectors** for generating ideas on what to trade.
* [Yahoo Finance Industry Browser](http://biz.yahoo.com/p/sum_conameu.html): List of all **industries** for generating ideas on what to trade
* [Yahoo Finance InPlay](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/inplay-briefing-com-055139997.html): I check this often in the morning to quickly scan news headlines that will move stocks.
* [Is The Stock Market Open?](http://www.isthemarketopen.com/): Well, is it? 
* [Chartgame!](http://www.chartgame.com/): Time lapse trading game. Great for practicing your identification of technical analysis patterns for swing trading without having to wait for months to collect a good amount of data from your trades.
* [The Ultimate Swing Trading Guide](http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/): Great beginners' guide for learning to swing trade. Read this from beginning to end, in order. It can be done in a weekend. 
* [Hoovers IPO Central](http://www.hoovers.com/ipo-central/100004160-1.html): Everything you could ever want to know about IPOs. 
* [ShortSqueeze](http://www.shortsqueeze.com): Great for quickly checking how much of a company is currently held short...can help identify short squeezes that really rip.
* [Tradervue](http://www.tradervue.com): Great trade tracking and statistics website for tracking your performance. It's free for up to 100 trades per month. Useful if you're trying to develop a trading system and need data on what works/what doesn't. 
* [My Trades](http://www.tradervue.com/shared/users/1460): Over 2,200 of my shared trades with notes on why I took them, where I bought/sold, where my stop was, etc. I update this occasionally but usually do it in blocks every few months now. 
* [Finviz Economic Calendar](http://www.finviz.com/calendar.ashx): Good for being prepared for upcoming economic news like GDP data, FOMC minutes, etc. 

**CRUCIAL READING/BLOGS/ETC**:

* [Forensic Investing Red Flags](http://www.bus.lsu.edu/accounting/faculty/napostolou/forensic.html): Good resource for finding holes in a company's fundamentals and red flags in financial statements/reporting.
* [Best time of day for trading](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/recent/learn_the_best_times_of_the_day_for_the_best_trades-2-677749.html): Cool article on the best time of day to place certain trades and how the market reacts to changes in time. 
* [The Trillionaire Next Door](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620767/daytradersbullet): Hilarious book about day trading. Should be on every full time trader's desk to keep the stress of trading at bay.
* [The Logical Trader](http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Trader-Mark-B-Fisher/dp/0471215511/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330402471&sr=8-1): Great book about Mark Fisher's trading style and how he keeps trading simple. Simple is good. 
* [Trading From Your Gut](http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Your-Gut-Instinct-Smarts/dp/0137047681): Awesome book about properly using your right brain/left brain to trade more accurately and more confidently.
* [Anything by Brett Steenbarger](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_10?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=brett%20steenbarger&sprefix=brett+stee%2Cstripbooks%2C232): Great author of many trading books. I found Daily Trading Coach and Enhancing Trader Performance to be really useful and practical. 
* [Anything by Mark Douglas](http://www.amazon.com/Mark-Douglas/e/B001IGOXOE/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_5?qid=1414900959&sr=1-5): Another great author that provides practical stuff you can actually use rather than just useless theory. I like Trading in the Zone and The Disciplined Trader the best. 
* [Anything by Marcel Link](http://www.amazon.com/Marcel-Link/e/B001IGJO7K/ref=ntt_aut_sim_3_2): Great author of books designed to help you improve your performance through strategy development. 
* [Darvas Trader](http://www.darvastrader.com/): Great blog with tons of awesome articles. I read it regularly.
* [Your Daily Watchlist](http://www.yourdailywatchlist.com/): Keith Kern's (@stt2318) website. He provides lots of nice charts both on Twitter and on this site. Many are free. Good for generating ideas. 
* [The Trader's Podcast](http://traderspodcast.com/): Amazing podcast with tons of short 10-30 minute episodes on everything you could ever imagine about trading.
* [Greenbar Trading Blog](http://www.greenbartrading.com/blog): My blog. I haven't updated it in a while but there are a lot of good articles in the archive about things I've learned and my journey to becoming a pro trader. 
* [OpenTrader Blog](http://blog.opentrader.com/): Awesome blog with lots of eye-opening articles on all things related to trading. 
* [Alpha Wolf Capital](http://vegastrader66.blogspot.com/): Great blog by a great full time trader named Tim Weintraut out of Vegas. I traded with him for a week recently and was blown away by his knowledge. He has been trading for over 20 years and is a great guy. I contacted him via Twitter out of nowhere and he had never even met me and allowed me to come stay in his house and trade with him for a week and hang w/ his family! 
* [Trade on the Fly](http://www.tradeonthefly.com/): Another great trader I met recently and traded with for a week in Montana. Michele is a swing trader and posts tons of great charts. She moderates the swing trading room in Nate Michaud's (@investorslive) chat room. 
* [Bulls on Wall Street](http://bullsonwallstreet.com/blog/): Nice blog run by a good buddy of mine, Kunal Desai. He is kinda a wacko but he's a pretty good trader and his blog has lots of free info and education on it. Really funny guy too!
* [10 Traits of Successful Traders](http://bullsonwallstreet.com/10-traits-successful-students-turned-traders/): Good article on what it takes to become a full time trader. Kunal pumps a lot of his students in this article including me and for him it's more of a marketing tool to sell his bootcamp but I still think it's great for people to read to see what it takes and learn some of the characteristics of the traders he's worked with who really took off and became extremely profitable.

* [FreeStockCharts](http://www.freestockcharts.com): The best free charting software out there. If you are not advanced enough to be using the trading software above but the charts on Google Finance and Yahoo Finance aren't good enough for you, this is your answer.
* [TradingView](http://www.tradingview.com): Another good (and free!) chart site if you don't have pro trading software.

**SCANNERS/SCREENERS:**

* [StockFetcher](http://www.stockfetcher.com): The best bang for the buck hands down when it comes to scanning. Very powerful and easy to code. I use it literally every single day and it's cheaper than Netflix!
* [Finviz Screener](http://www.finviz.com/screener.ashx): Great for screening stocks with all kinds of characteristics from descriptive to fundamental to technical. Screens can be saved 
* [StockMarketWatch Screener](http://thestockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/today.aspx): Nice scan I run each morning to find the stocks that are gapping up/down the most. These will be the ones in play for that day. Combining this with Finviz I can throw all the gappers into Finviz and check the news on them quickly and easily.
* [Google Finance Screener](https://www.google.com/finance/stockscreener): Similar to Finviz's screener but allows you to screen on some different stuff like [float](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/091004.asp) which Finviz doesn't allow. 
* [StockCharts Predefined Scans](http://stockcharts.com/def/servlet/SC.scan): Great list of predefined scans for generating trading ideas. 

**USEFUL WEBSITES:**

* [StreetInsider Earnings Insider](http://www.streetinsider.com/portal/Earnings+Insider/5.html): Great for quickly determining if a company met, beat or missed earnings, what their consensus was, and what their guidance was. Also provides next expected EPS date.
* [Zacks Earnings](http://www.zacks.com): Just type the ticker into the quote box in the upper right and look under the ""key earnings data"" section to find the next earnings date. I've found Zacks' dates to be the most accurate over many years of trading.
* [ETF Replay](http://www.etfreplay.com/summary/1.aspx): Great summary of ETF performance for gauging sector performance and finding strength when all seems weak, weakness when all seems strong. 
* [Finviz ETF Maps](http://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=etf): Same as above.
* [Bespoke ETF Cheat Sheets](http://www.bespokeinvest.com/thinkbig/2012/7/30/bespokes-full-line-of-etf-cheat-sheets.html): Looking for an ETF that relates to what you're trading? Check out these cheat sheets for ideas.
* [Yahoo Finance Sector List](http://biz.yahoo.com/p/s_peeu.html): List of all **sectors** for generating ideas on what to trade.
* [Yahoo Finance Industry Browser](http://biz.yahoo.com/p/sum_conameu.html): List of all **industries** for generating ideas on what to trade
* [Yahoo Finance InPlay](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/inplay-briefing-com-055139997.html): I check this often in the morning to quickly scan news headlines that will move stocks.
* [Is The Stock Market Open?](http://www.isthemarketopen.com/): Well, is it? 
* [Chartgame!](http://www.chartgame.com/): Time lapse trading game. Great for practicing your identification of technical analysis patterns for swing trading without having to wait for months to collect a good amount of data from your trades.
* [The Ultimate Swing Trading Guide](http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/): Great beginners' guide for learning to swing trade. Read this from beginning to end, in order. It can be done in a weekend. 
* [Hoovers IPO Central](http://www.hoovers.com/ipo-central/100004160-1.html): Everything you could ever want to know about IPOs. 
* [ShortSqueeze](http://www.shortsqueeze.com): Great for quickly checking how much of a company is currently held short...can help identify short squeezes that really rip.
* [Tradervue](http://www.tradervue.com): Great trade tracking and statistics website for tracking your performance. It's free for up to 100 trades per month. Useful if you're trying to develop a trading system and need data on what works/what doesn't. 
* [My Trades](http://www.tradervue.com/shared/users/1460): Over 2,200 of my shared trades with notes on why I took them, where I bought/sold, where my stop was, etc. I update this occasionally but usually do it in blocks every few months now. 
* [Finviz Economic Calendar](http://www.finviz.com/calendar.ashx): Good for being prepared for upcoming economic news like GDP data, FOMC minutes, etc. 

**CRUCIAL READING/BLOGS/ETC**:

* [The Trillionaire Next Door](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620767/daytradersbullet): Hilarious book about day trading. Should be on every full time trader's desk to keep the stress of trading at bay.
* [The Logical Trader](http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Trader-Mark-B-Fisher/dp/0471215511/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330402471&sr=8-1): Great book about Mark Fisher's trading style and how he keeps trading simple. Simple is good.

I contacted him via Twitter out of nowhere and he had never even met me and allowed me to come stay in his house and trade with him for a week and hang w/ his family! 
* [Trade on the Fly](http://www.tradeonthefly.com/): Another great trader I met recently and traded with for a week in Montana. Michele is a swing trader and posts tons of great charts. She moderates the swing trading room in Nate Michaud's (@investorslive) chat room.

1702965950.0,StockMarket,Trading on macbook air,"My old macbook is no longer functioning & I'm thinking of getting macbook air M1 2020. I know it's not the most ideal laptop for trading but I'm used to using macbook. As someone very new to stock trading, I just have a few questions:

1. I often see people's trading set ups and it involves a lot of monitors. I know macbook is the worst option for this as it can connect only to 1 external monitor. My understanding is that people who use a lot of monitors in their set up are mostly doing intraday trading. Is this true?
2. I'm not interested in intraday trading. I'm more interested in swing trading and not gonna do it everyday. I've heard that some people just use ipads for this, nothing too fancy. Is this true as well?

I just wanna get the macbook air soon but I don't wanna have to buy another non-macbook laptop down the road just because it's too inconvenient for trading.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks.",0,19,"Trading on macbook air My old macbook is no longer functioning & I'm thinking of getting macbook air M1 2020.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks.",trading macbook air old macbook longer functioning im thinking getting macbook air know ideal laptop trading im used using macbook someone new stock trading

1605042695.0,StockMarket,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Nov 10, 2020","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 10, 2020**

Stocks traded choppily today, with market participants taking a breather after an initial wave of optimism over a potential coronavirus vaccine. Shares of tech companies remain under pressure, with the Nasdaq underperforming the other two major indices.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.79% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.14% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) outperformed, finishing 0.93% up.

Yesterday, Pfizer’s (PFE) and BioNTech’s (BNTX) announced that the vaccine candidate was 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 in patients participating in the clinical trial. The news fueled a market rally yesterday, with the SPY and DIA reaching intraday records. However, since the record-highs, both indices have pared gains. Stuart Kaiser, UBS Head of Equity Deritavtives Research, said, “I think the big surprise was the efficacy. I think you had polled investors before this, the efficacy range would have been 50-75% as sort of a wide range. And if this number is truly 90% or above, I think that is what the market is responding so positively to.”

In other positive from the medical sector, Eli Lilly (LLY) announced it received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its antibody therapy used to treat moderate to severe cases of COVID-19. This comes a few weeks after regeneron, a drug produced by Gildead (GILD) that also treats moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 was approved by the FDA. 

A successful vaccine is seen by market participants as a necessary component for safe, sustained, and broad economic reopening. According to Yahoo Finance, an estimate 27 million workers, around 22% of the workforce, work in close physical proximity with others. In order to safely and fully reopen the economy and return to some semblance of normalcy, a vaccine is a key component.

Still, despite the good news, it is important to note that widespread distribution of the vaccine may took months, after approval is granted. To produce enough doses and distribute them globally will be a massive, logistical undertaking, one that will take some time to put in place. Some analysts have cautioned to extrapolating positive vaccine data to thinking distribution is just around the corner. Carter Henderson, portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital, said ““The vaccine news is really a 2021 story and we still have the worst to deal with COVID, as cases run at new highs. So the vaccine is not an immediate fix. That’s why we believe stimulus is still on the table. So if we get news about stimulus early in next year coupled with vaccine news, we think the market could have a true melt-up.”

News: [Quantitative Tightening Goes Global for the First Time, in Test for Markets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-22/central-bank-qt-goes-global-fed-ecb-boj-are-all-doing-quantitative-tightening)

* [**SNOW**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d) - Earnings beat, .18 vs .16 EPS expected. $868M vs $852M revenue expected. Raised guidance, and announced $2.5B buyback program. Cites that CRWD incident had no impact at all from a consumption standpoint. Market simply sees this stock as overvalued (from what I can glean).

* [**TEM**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TEM&p=d) - Had a huge spike yesterday off no news two days ago, then a decently steady up-move yesterday. Watching the $75 level, but not too interested in it otherwise.

* [**ASTS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d) - Oddly enough, I have a negative bias towards the stock now. We’ve failed to see the stock break $40, the range that it moves in a day is slowly decreasing and we’re seeing less volume compared to the move from 21->33. Currently short a nominal position, but have a stop in case we spike off the open like yesterday

* [**LUNR**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d) - Again, watching the $6 level today. CEO stated “key award discussions in the coming week” which is heavily implied to be, but not confirmed, the NSNS contract worth nearly $540M. PLEASE remember this when trading this.

Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Is \_\_\_ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.

News: [Quantitative Tightening Goes Global for the First Time, in Test for Markets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-22/central-bank-qt-goes-global-fed-ecb-boj-are-all-doing-quantitative-tightening)

* [**SNOW**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d) - Earnings beat, .18 vs .16 EPS expected. $868M vs $852M revenue expected. Raised guidance, and announced $2.5B buyback program. Cites that CRWD incident had no impact at all from a consumption standpoint. Market simply sees this stock as overvalued (from what I can glean).

* [**TEM**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TEM&p=d) - Had a huge spike yesterday off no news two days ago, then a decently steady up-move yesterday. Watching the $75 level, but not too interested in it otherwise.

* [**ASTS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d) - Oddly enough, I have a negative bias towards the stock now. We’ve failed to see the stock break $40, the range that it moves in a day is slowly decreasing and we’re seeing less volume compared to the move from 21->33. Currently short a nominal position, but have a stop in case we spike off the open like yesterday

* [**LUNR**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d) - Again, watching the $6 level today. CEO stated “key award discussions in the coming week” which is heavily implied to be, but not confirmed, the NSNS contract worth nearly $540M. PLEASE remember this when trading this.

* [**BEN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BEN&p=d) - [SEC investigating co-CIO of firm’s Western Asset Unit](https://www.ft.com/content/39d30d90-e28a-4851-85e2-ab4503f1f015), stock sold off massively intraday yesterday. Watching again today in case of another selloff.

1674890700.0,StockMarket,"Why This May Be A 'Life Changing' Market Rally; Apple, Fed Meeting Loom As Tesla Run Hits 75%","Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.

The stock market rally cleared some major resistance in the past week. The major indexes had solid gains, responding bullishly to uneven earnings reports and economic data. Leading stocks acted well, with breakouts and buy points continuing to work.

Since the Jan. 6 follow-through day, the market rally has shown robust gains. In fact, the advance suggests this uptrend could be a ""moneymaker"" or even a ""life-changing"" rally, according to one noted growth investor.

So investors should be taking advantage of the opportunities. But do so carefully. The market rally is around key levels, while it's another big week for news.

`Apple` (`AAPL`), Google parent `Alphabet` (`GOOGL`), `Amazon` (`AMZN`), Facebook parent Meta Platforms (`META`) are all on tap, as well as hundreds of other companies. Apple stock and these other tech titans are rebounding strongly, but have a lot of repair work. Still, their earnings and guidance will be key for the market rally as well as many other tech stocks.

The Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting this coming week, with another rate hike expected on Feb. 1. The big question is when Fed chief Jerome Powell and his colleagues call a halt to further rate increases.

`Tesla` (`TSLA`) skyrocketed on mixed earnings as CEO Elon Musk was bullish about the future. TSLA stock soared from its Jan. 6 bear market low, but isn't yet offering a buy point.

Meanwhile, Tesla archrival BYD (`BYDDF`), Snowflake (`SNOW`), Shift4Payments (`FOUR`) and Etsy (`ETSY`) are four aggressive stocks in or near potential buy areas. But handle them with care.

ETSY stock is on SwingTrader. FOUR stock is on the `IBD 50`.

# Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures open at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures.

Remember that overnight action in `Dow futures` and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular  `us stock market` session.

# Stock Market Rally

The stock market rally had strong gains across the board this past week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.8% in last week's `stock market trading`. The S&P 500 index jumped 2.5%. The Nasdaq composite leapt 4.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 2.4%.

U.S. crude oil futures fell 2.4% to $79.68 a barrel during the week, reversing from a recent high of $82.48 intraday Friday.

The 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 3.52%.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates by just a quarter point on Feb. 1, after a half-point move in December and four straight hikes of 75 basis points before that. Markets overwhelmingly expect another quarter-point hike in late March, to a 4.75%-5% range. But investors are now betting that policymakers will hold steady.

# ETFs

Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (`FFTY`) advanced 2.5% last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (`IGV`) popped 4.5%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (`SMH`) rallied 5.2% to a five-month high.

Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (`ARKK`) soared 10.7% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (`ARKG`) jumped 5%. Tesla stock is a major holding across Ark Invest's ETFs, with Cathie Wood's Ark loading up on shares in recent months. Ark also owns a small stake in BYD.

SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (`XME`) climbed 2.1% last week to an eight-month high. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (`PAVE`) climbed 3.3%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) edged up 0.3%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (`XHB`) stepped up 3.3%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) climbed 0.8%, its seventh straight weekly gain. The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) advanced 2.55%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (`XLV`) fell 0.8%, a fifth straight weekly decline.

# Megacap Earnings

Meta Platform earnings are due Wednesday night. META stock rallied for a fifth straight week, leaping 8.9% to just below its 200-day line.

Apple earnings are due Thursday night. It'll likely be a rough quarter, with iPhone production delays taking a toll. But AAPL stock jumped 5.85% last week, closing in on its 200-day line.

Google earnings are also late Thursday. GOOGL stock shrugged off a new Justice Department antitrust suit to ultimately climb 1.4%. But it's still some distance from its 200-day.

Amazon earnings also are slated after Thursday's closing bell. AMZN stock tested 50-day line support on Wednesday morning but roared higher for a 5.1% weekly gain. Shares are still well below their 200-day line.

## Tesla Stock

https://preview.redd.it/azq1v444hqea1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dd374d2f1a8dba3c4de3498c9a809f7e6937d98

Tesla stock surged 33% last week, rocketing above its 50-day line. Since its Jan. 6 bear-market low of 101.84, TSLA stock has erupted for a 75% gain.

On Wednesday night, Tesla earnings slightly beat lowered analyst views, while revenue was roughly in line. But shares spiked as Elon Musk was bullish on demand following price cuts and predicted production of up to 2 million vehicles.

Will revived Tesla demand be sustained? It may be several weeks before there's a clear picture. By Tuesday morning, investors should get some weekly China EV registration data for Tesla and other automakers. However, Tesla Shanghai was closed this past week for the Chinese New Year holiday, which likely also affected demand. Later in the week, investors will get January sales data from BYD, Nio (`NIO`), Li Auto (`LI`) and XPeng (`XPEV`), but not Tesla.

## Market Rally Analysis

The stock market rally ticked off a lot of boxes this past week.

The major indexes tested support midweek and passed with flying colors. By Friday's close, the Nasdaq composite had rallied above its 200-day moving average and its December highs. The Russell 2000 also nudged above its late 2022 peaks intraday Friday. The S&P 500, now decisively above its 200-day line, is on the cusp of topping its December highs. The Dow Jones, now the laggard, is doing fine as well.

&#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/za6ynat4iqea1.png?width=1255&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97db5452e3e2306795e1fd5486c4bc3f7b50938)

The indexes faded into Friday's close, paring daily gains. But that's after finishing near intraday highs for six straight sessions. Strong closes are a hallmark of bull markets. `stock market movers`	

The action has come amid a barrage of earnings and guidance that was often weak or lackluster, along with mixed economic data. But it's not the news, it's the reaction to the news.

Meanwhile, leading stocks continue to act well. While Tesla has skyrocketed and this column highlighted aggressive names such as Etsy and SNOW stock, this is a broad-based advance. Energy, steelmakers, housing-related groups, retailers, financials, auto parts, travel, trucking and more are showing strength sector-wide and in individual stocks.

Investors are turning more bullish in part because they see brighter, clearer prospects for the economy. China and Europe are shoring up global growth while inflation is cooling. The Fed is close to being finished raising rates.

Still, earnings season remains intense. While Apple stock, Google, Amazon and Meta don't have buy points, their reports — and hundreds of others — could still roil the market. The Fed may be more hawkish than expected. Big economic reports, including Friday's January jobs report, also will be important.

## A 'Life Changer' Market Rally?

Still, the 2023 market rally's strong start is a very bullish signal.

Eric Krull, co-author of ""The Lifecycle Trade,"" `noted on Friday's IBD Live` that the Nasdaq composite had risen 8.9% from the close of the Jan. 6 follow-through day to Thursday's close. That 15-day gain is unusually high. Krull says that ""moneymaker"" rallies typically see a 5.5% gain over a similar span. For ""life changer"" rallies, the average advance is nearly 8%.

## What To Do Now

You don't want life to pass you by, or life-changing rallies, so you should be taking advantage of the current market uptrend. The strong advance in the major indexes and leading stocks shows a real character change from the choppy October-December uptrend.

So work on your watchlists, looking for stocks setting up or actionable now. Pay attention to earnings dates.

# Megacap Earnings

Meta Platform earnings are due Wednesday night. META stock rallied for a fifth straight week, leaping 8.9% to just below its 200-day line.

Apple earnings are due Thursday night. It'll likely be a rough quarter, with iPhone production delays taking a toll. But AAPL stock jumped 5.85% last week, closing in on its 200-day line.

Google earnings are also late Thursday. GOOGL stock shrugged off a new Justice Department antitrust suit to ultimately climb 1.4%. But it's still some distance from its 200-day.

Amazon earnings also are slated after Thursday's closing bell. AMZN stock tested 50-day line support on Wednesday morning but roared higher for a 5.1% weekly gain. Shares are still well below their 200-day line.

## Tesla Stock

https://preview.redd.it/azq1v444hqea1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dd374d2f1a8dba3c4de3498c9a809f7e6937d98

Tesla stock surged 33% last week, rocketing above its 50-day line. Since its Jan. 6 bear-market low of 101.84, TSLA stock has erupted for a 75% gain.

On Wednesday night, Tesla earnings slightly beat lowered analyst views, while revenue was roughly in line. But shares spiked as Elon Musk was bullish on demand following price cuts and predicted production of up to 2 million vehicles.

Will revived Tesla demand be sustained? It may be several weeks before there's a clear picture. By Tuesday morning, investors should get some weekly China EV registration data for Tesla and other automakers. However, Tesla Shanghai was closed this past week for the Chinese New Year holiday, which likely also affected demand. Later in the week, investors will get January sales data from BYD, Nio (`NIO`), Li Auto (`LI`) and XPeng (`XPEV`), but not Tesla.

## Market Rally Analysis

The stock market rally ticked off a lot of boxes this past week.

The major indexes tested support midweek and passed with flying colors. By Friday's close, the Nasdaq composite had rallied above its 200-day moving average and its December highs. The Russell 2000 also nudged above its late 2022 peaks intraday Friday. The S&P 500, now decisively above its 200-day line, is on the cusp of topping its December highs. The Dow Jones, now the laggard, is doing fine as well.

The indexes faded into Friday's close, paring daily gains. But that's after finishing near intraday highs for six straight sessions. Strong closes are a hallmark of bull markets. `stock market movers`	

The action has come amid a barrage of earnings and guidance that was often weak or lackluster, along with mixed economic data. But it's not the news, it's the reaction to the news.

Meanwhile, leading stocks continue to act well. While Tesla has skyrocketed and this column highlighted aggressive names such as Etsy and SNOW stock, this is a broad-based advance. Energy, steelmakers, housing-related groups, retailers, financials, auto parts, travel, trucking and more are showing strength sector-wide and in individual stocks.

Investors are turning more bullish in part because they see brighter, clearer prospects for the economy. China and Europe are shoring up global growth while inflation is cooling. The Fed is close to being finished raising rates.

Still, earnings season remains intense. While Apple stock, Google, Amazon and Meta don't have buy points, their reports — and hundreds of others — could still roil the market. The Fed may be more hawkish than expected. Big economic reports, including Friday's January jobs report, also will be important.

## A 'Life Changer' Market Rally?

Still, the 2023 market rally's strong start is a very bullish signal.

Eric Krull, co-author of ""The Lifecycle Trade,"" `noted on Friday's IBD Live` that the Nasdaq composite had risen 8.9% from the close of the Jan. 6 follow-through day to Thursday's close. That 15-day gain is unusually high. Krull says that ""moneymaker"" rallies typically see a 5.5% gain over a similar span. For ""life changer"" rallies, the average advance is nearly 8%.

## What To Do Now

You don't want life to pass you by, or life-changing rallies, so you should be taking advantage of the current market uptrend. The strong advance in the major indexes and leading stocks shows a real character change from the choppy October-December uptrend.

So work on your watchlists, looking for stocks setting up or actionable now. Pay attention to earnings dates.

1721221379.0,StockMarket,These are the stocks on my watchlist (7/17),"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities.  
This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.

Measured from current extremes, I expect that the unwinding of this bubble will drag S&P 500 total returns below Treasury bill returns for least a decade, and possibly two.

 **Yet like other bubbles, I expect that most of the damage will come off the top, resulting in market conditions that are reasonably investable within a year or two**. 

Presently, the valuation measures we find best correlated with actual subsequent market returns are at the most extreme levels in U.S. history. 

Moreover, as I’ve detailed before, the low level of interest rates does nothing to improve those prospective returns.

#  It is a fiction that stocks, at any price, are better than low-yielding bonds

# Yes, bond yields are lower than they were in 2000, but equity valuations are also more extreme. 

**The end result for** ***relative*** **returns is likely to be similar to that of previous bubbles**. 

# Even an “error” as large as the one we’ve seen in the past 12 years (which would require future valuations to remain at bubble extremes) would leave S&P 500 total returns at or below the lowly returns on Treasury bonds.

#  When bubble meets trouble

A few of Jeremy Grantham’s observations about speculative bubbles should not be missed. Not just because they agree with our own thinking, but because hearing the same concepts in different words, from a different speaker, can often deepen ones understanding.

**“How high the peak is has no bearing at all on what the fair value is. What it does change is the amount of pain that you get to go back to fair value and below. I’ve been very clear about what I consider a definition of success – and that is only that, sooner or later, you will have made money to have sidestepped the bubble phase.”**

This is a point I’ve emphasized often, but it can’t be repeated enough: amplifying a bubble doesn’t somehow avoid its consequences – it makes those consequences worse. Amplifying a bubble doesn’t even create “wealth” for the economy as a whole, only temporary opportunities for wealth transfer *between* individuals. That’s because the wealth isn’t *in* the price – it’s in the future stream of cash flows. If one holder sells, the next buyer has to hold the bag, and ultimately it’s the cash flows that matter. The only thing progressively higher valuations do is to progressively lower the long-term returns that investors will subsequently enjoy if they buy (or hold) at those valuations.

 

# One of the things that you may have noticed is that our downside targets for the markets don’t simply slide up in parallel with the market. Most analysts have an ingrained ‘15% correction’ mentality, such that no matter how high prices advance, the probable maximum downside risk is just 15% or so (and that would be considered bad). Factually speaking, however, that’s not the way it works. The inconvenient fact is that valuation ultimately matters. That has led to the rather peculiar risk projections that have appeared in this letter in recent months. Trend uniformity helps to postpone that reality, but in the end, there it is. Given current conditions, it is increasingly likely that valuations will begin to matter with a vengeance.

I’ve often observed that risk management is generous. Being on the sidelines during a late-stage bubble can feel horrible, but the “missed” gains are typically transient. Invariably, rich valuations are followed by very long periods where the market either collapses or goes nowhere in an interesting way. Consider the 14-year period from May 1995 to March 2009 – two financial bubbles in the interim, yet in the end, the S&P 500 lagged Treasury bills for the full period. The S&P 500 lagged T-bills for the 21-year period from February 1961 to August 1982, a span that included the “Go-Go” bubble of the late-1960’s and its collapse, along with the blue chip (Nifty Fifty) bubble that collapsed in 1973-74. The easy one, of course, was the 16-year period from November 1916 to May 1932, which included the bubble of the roaring 20’s and its subsequent collapse in 1929-1932.

# The result is the same if you measure from the bubble peaks. The S&P 500 lagged Treasury bills from 1929-1947, 1966-1985, and 2000-2013. 50 years out of an 84-year period. That’s just what overvalued markets do.",13,42,"""When Bubble Meets Trouble"" By John P.

# The result is the same if you measure from the bubble peaks. The S&P 500 lagged Treasury bills from 1929-1947, 1966-1985, and 2000-2013. 50 years out of an 84-year period.

1707421312.0,StockMarket,(Forbes) Disney shares staged one of their strongest single-day rallies ever this Thursday on the back of the company’s blowout earnings report; significantly upping their guidance expecting further upside.,"***Forbes***: ***Disney Stock Soars: Set For Best Day Since 2020***.

*""Disney shares staged one of their strongest single-day rallies this millennium Thursday on the back of the company’s blowout earnings report, though the entertainment titan still has a ways to go to recapture its former glory on the stock market.*

*Disney’s stock ballooned almost 13% to just shy of $112 by mid-afternoon, hitting its highest intraday level since Feb. 9, 2023. Should the gains hold, Thursday will be Disney stock’s best day since December 2020 and its fifth-best day since 2000, according to FactSet data.*

*The dramatic rise for Disney came a day after the company delivered strong quarterly results and projected $4.60 earnings per share for its fiscal year ending in September, which would make 2024 its most profitable fiscal year since 2019.*

*Bank of America was among several Wall Street firms to dramatically bump its price target for Disney, upping its target from $110 to $130, with analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich remarking they were “incredibly encouraged” by Disney’s bottom line progress under the tutelage of CEO Bob Iger, whose initiatives “are already having an impact” 15 months into Iger’s second tenure at the helm of Disney.""*

1716904575.0,StockMarket,I need some advanced book recommendations based on what I have previously read. ,"I am a short term swing trader (max 2-3 months), I dont do intraday nor I do options trading. I stick to cash markets (sometimes futures) and as of now I only prefer some pattern based trading as they have delivered results and I didnt want to take unnecessary risk without in-depth knowledge. I wish to expand my knowledge more and slowly increase by risk taking capability. I have read the following books : -

1. John Murphy - Technical Analysis of Financial Markets   
2. John Murphy - The Visual Investor   
3. Van Tharp - Trade Your Way To Financial Freedom   
4. Jack Schwager - Market Wizards 

5. Thomas Bulkowski - Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns 

What other books do you recommend me ?  I am looking to try my hand in intraday or options for a while so I some books on it would help as well. I know its all about experience but still we need basic knowledge. Other relevant books from short term trading or trading psychology are welcome as well.

I’m a about a month in, and my unrealized profit is a little over 3k. In this particular game, it gives you 100k to play with, and follows the real market. So far my portfolio is 80% individuals stocks, and the rest is bonds, mutual funds and cash. I know this would be a terrible strategy with real money, as I’ve seen +5k and -5k within the same week, but I need some volatility if I’m going to make a good profit in such a short amount of time. Any recommendations of what I should buy, hold, or sell?

A hedge fund that reaped an outrageous gain in February’s vol-mageddon is eyeing a fresh target.  Houndstooth Capital Management LLC secured a 6,000 percent return from a bearish bet on an exchange-traded product tied to calm markets.  Now, the $7.5 million fund sees trouble in an ETF designed to profit from the opposite -- turbulence in stocks. It’s wagering technical forces in the volatility complex will help spur a swift return to stability in the wake of a blowout, undoing the leveraged product in its wake.   It goes like this: Even though Houndstooth expects another surge in price swings, it’s using out-of-the-money puts with near-term maturities to bet against the $413 million ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF. UVXY, as it is known, is one of the most liquid, leveraged ETFs that profit from rising volatility. The theory is that after an initial spike there will be a snapback in vol that will decimate the product.  “We’re looking for areas where buying or selling volatility is mispriced by the market, or at least where we think there’s a very good risk-reward trade-off,” Lincoln Edwards, founder at Houndstooth, said in an interview. “There’s a risk that another massive VIX spike could destroy UVXY in a single day.”  Tucker Hewes, a spokesman for ProShares at Hewes Communications, declined to comment.  At $70,000 the trade is modest, but it highlights the contentious issue of whether securities such as UVXY can exert an outsize pull on the very contracts they track, exacerbating their own volatility in the process.  Hot Summer  Volatility investing has boomed in recent years as ETPs offered cheap and liquid ways for professional money managers and retail investors to punt on the burgeoning asset class. As Wall Street warns of a “hot” summer full of risk, and a more normal regime for volatility after two placid years, many traders are betting on bigger price swings in the latter half of the year.   And that’s how Houndstooth made its spectacular February return. The Austin, Texas-based firm bought put options on the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, or SVXY, thinking that an upward move in the Cboe Volatility Index would shake sellers out of their torpor. Sure enough, the gauge staged a record-one day spike, sending the ETF plummeting 83 percent -- and handing the fund its best-ever first quarter with a double-digit gain.  Houndstooth reckons it has a keen eye for technical risks in the underbelly of the volatility complex. Since the VIX isn’t tradable, many products hold futures contracts on the gauge. Given their size, some participants say they can exert a large pull on the price of the assets they track, underscored by the spectacular collapse of ETNs linked to calm markets in February.  Both long and short products buy and sell futures contracts on a daily basis to maintain their desired degree of exposure to implied equity volatility. That means a large one-way move in the VIX can dramatically increase the number of contracts they need to buy -- challenging liquidity and potentially driving the price of futures higher, according to Edwards.   Cboe Global Markets Inc. didn’t immediately respond to an email request seeking comment. It has recently outlined changes to the monthly auction for the VIX settlement.  Scenarios  For the Houndstooth strategy to pay off, VIX futures need to lose two-thirds of their value in a single day. That, in theory, would be enough to send the price of the 1.5-times leveraged UVXY to zero.  “Even if VIX futures gained 200 percent or even 10,000 percent in a single day, a one-day decline of 66 percent makes UVXY worth $0 regardless of how high it climbed,” Edwards said.  Of course, the grip ETFs assert on VIX futures likely diminished after February, as products either closed or shrank, while several ProShares ETFs reduced leverage, including UVXY, curbing their need to rebalance after sharp moves.  And the scenario didn’t play out after the VIX’s record spike on Feb. 5. The next day, the volatility gauge slumped by one-fifth -- only enough to send UVXY down by a third for the day.  Still, buying put options on the ETF rather than shorting it allows Houndstooth to limit potential losses on the trade, and there are a few scenarios that could lead to its success.  Under one, the VIX spikes from its current level to 40. The next day, as panic eases, the gauge knifes back down, its movements exacerbated by long buyers rushing to cover positions, and by volatility products flooding the futures market to rebalance holdings.  In another, the VIX could surge on bad-news speculation and then quickly reverse, producing a large enough intraday spike for the bet to pay off. Alternatively, the gauge could gradually climb higher -- only to deflate suddenly if favorable news emerges.  Edwards believes volatility is poised to move higher as November’s U.S. congressional elections approach.  “We’ll also see a third interest-rate hike, which will spark much more volatility than what we’re seeing now. Political uncertainty in Europe will continue causing major fits of volatility. Expect to see the VIX over 30 at least one more time this year,” he said.   The Houndstooth investor concedes that a 6,000 percent return on the strategy is a tail scenario -- but one “that’s massively underappreciated and underpriced.”",147,37,"Hedge Fund That Made 6,000% on VIX Jump Bets on Next Blow-Up [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-28/hedge-fund-that-made-6-000-on-vix-surge-wagers-on-next-blow-up](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-28/hedge-fund-that-made-6-000-on-vix-surge-wagers-on-next-blow-up)

1651603713.0,StockMarket,"Long SPY calls before tomorrow’s Fed rate decision, using a modest position size for a highly specular trade.","Summary:

We expect a short-term bounce from current level, either at the FOMC decision tomorrow, or at May 11 release of April CPI. 

Our trade:  

We entered a modest SPY call position near open today, will double the position size if market declines significantly before or after FOMC decision tomorrow
 
Analysis:

•	Major indices have declined significantly since their recent highs, and technical setup favors a short term bounce at the minimum

o	Nasdaq 100 down 22% from its Nov 2021 high. S&P500 down 14% from its Jan 2022 high and is now at a price to 2022 earnings ratio of 18, approaching long term average (15 to 20, depending on how far back you look)

o	SPY Feb 24 intraday low retested but held (as of now) going into FOMC decision tomorrow

o	Market sentiment stabilized, with VIX, 52-week high/low, high-yield spread, put/call ratio all show divergence as broad market intraday moved below Feb 24 intraday low on Monday


•	Fed rate and balance sheet decision has largely price in; there are unlikely to be negative surprises

o	Investors have priced in a 100% chance for a 50 bps rate hike for tomorrow’s meeting, a 94% chance for a 75 bps hike in June, and expecting a roughly $95bn/month balance sheet reduction and Fed fund rate to exceed 3% (from current target range at 25-50 bps) by the end of 2022

o	To retain credibility, Fed needs to show resolve to fight inflation. But at the same time, Fed has to ensure that its action will not introduce instability in the global financial market  

o	Fed has been prepping the market since its last meeting, and will take what market gave them. But with the war, market volatility, China lockdown, Euro zone at the brink of recession, and supply disruptions, Fed is unlikely to roil the market by going beyond what market expects

o	FOMC decision tomorrow will likely remove some uncertainties for some market participants


•	April CPI report on May 11 will likely create the impression that inflation has peaked

o	Major commodity prices except food have either declined or stabilized from early March high - oil moved sideways, copper down 15%, aluminum down 20%, and lumber down 8%

o	Wage continues to move up slowly, but it lags CPI and is unlikely to move CPI higher from the current level

o	Market turmoil, China lockdown, Euro zone weakness will also likely keep consumer sentiment and demand in check. Service component of CPI is unlikely to move much higher when consumers are looking to stretch their budget

o	Inflation likely will remain high given the lag b/w goods price and wage/commodity price, but the base effect – CPI jumped from 2.6% to 4.2% from March 2021 to April 2021 and move higher to 7% by Dec 2021 – will likely to make April 2022 (release on May 11) and subsequent CPI looks better

o	China lockdown and the associated supply disruption a major risk factor, but high inventory level at corps will likely cushion the blow, and the lockdown is likely short term in nature

o	SPY Feb 24 intraday low retested but held (as of now) going into FOMC decision tomorrow

o	Market sentiment stabilized, with VIX, 52-week high/low, high-yield spread, put/call ratio all show divergence as broad market intraday moved below Feb 24 intraday low on Monday


•	Fed rate and balance sheet decision has largely price in; there are unlikely to be negative surprises

o	Investors have priced in a 100% chance for a 50 bps rate hike for tomorrow’s meeting, a 94% chance for a 75 bps hike in June, and expecting a roughly $95bn/month balance sheet reduction and Fed fund rate to exceed 3% (from current target range at 25-50 bps) by the end of 2022

o	To retain credibility, Fed needs to show resolve to fight inflation. But at the same time, Fed has to ensure that its action will not introduce instability in the global financial market  

o	Fed has been prepping the market since its last meeting, and will take what market gave them. But with the war, market volatility, China lockdown, Euro zone at the brink of recession, and supply disruptions, Fed is unlikely to roil the market by going beyond what market expects

o	FOMC decision tomorrow will likely remove some uncertainties for some market participants


•	April CPI report on May 11 will likely create the impression that inflation has peaked

o	Major commodity prices except food have either declined or stabilized from early March high - oil moved sideways, copper down 15%, aluminum down 20%, and lumber down 8%

o	Wage continues to move up slowly, but it lags CPI and is unlikely to move CPI higher from the current level

o	Market turmoil, China lockdown, Euro zone weakness will also likely keep consumer sentiment and demand in check. Service component of CPI is unlikely to move much higher when consumers are looking to stretch their budget

o	Inflation likely will remain high given the lag b/w goods price and wage/commodity price, but the base effect – CPI jumped from 2.6% to 4.2% from March 2021 to April 2021 and move higher to 7% by Dec 2021 – will likely to make April 2022 (release on May 11) and subsequent CPI looks better

o	China lockdown and the associated supply disruption a major risk factor, but high inventory level at corps will likely cushion the blow, and the lockdown is likely short term in nature

1616100430.0,StockMarket,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 18, 2021"," 

Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks.  Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

As of March 17, 73.7 million Americans—22.2% of the total population, and 28.5% of those 18 and older—had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according [to data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) from the Centers for Disease Control. That’s up from 62.5 million a week ago. 40 million Americans, or 15.5% of the total adult population has been fully vaccinated.

“In my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?” - Li Lu",47,32,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 18, 2021  

Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks.  Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

As of March 17, 73.7 million Americans—22.2% of the total population, and 28.5% of those 18 and older—had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according [to data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) from the Centers for Disease Control.

1616185167.0,StockMarket,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 19, 2021","Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday. Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC’s comments earlier this week. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued \[Thursday\].” It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.

Despite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed’s accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish

1691699176.0,StockMarket,SP500 Futures Technical Analysis & Trading Plan,"*I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas.*

***Recap***: It’s been a day trading paradise lately and today brought more intraday volatility, a trader’s best friend. In this volatility, there were very many tradeable setups from the plan. The one that I took was mapped directly to this part of the plan: *“It’s still important for bulls to hold the line at* ***4506*** *and I would look for a recovery of the level from below”*. Right after CPI was released, the market put in a quick auction down to major support at **4494** and then recovered **4506**. I entered here and exited the majority of the trade at the next level at **4518**. I left a runner to get taken out by a trailing stop. 

As I often do, I switched to paper trading and traded three other scenarios from the plan, each of which set up perfectly: 1) The short from **4518** down to **4506**; 2) Support at **4483**, exiting at **4494**; 3) Support at **4494** and exiting at **4506**.

***Balance/Trend***: The market remains in a trend down over the past week or so and we have now seen a 160-point selloff from the recent peak at about **4635.** The market is now in a broadening pattern described below, but the most recent action has certainly been down. The market is now hovering at the inner bound of the aqua trendline channel, but the lows at **4458** need to hold if this trend is to stay.

***Analysis***: The market tested **4494** (and surrounding levels) on six separate occasions over the last week and rallied each time to about **4545**, creating what appears to be a broadening descending wedge pattern with the red line as resistance and the lower dotted black line as support. If anybody knows more about this pattern, please chime in. The market is still filling it out and statistically, usually sees a breakout to the upside and continuation. Inside of this pattern, there is a lot of volatility (that’s what created it) and so we may still see these swings up and down while the market finds its footing. Today’s close near the lows are not exactly encouraging, but with more important data ahead tomorrow, we have to wait to see if this means anything.

***Recap***: It’s been a day trading paradise lately and today brought more intraday volatility, a trader’s best friend. In this volatility, there were very many tradeable setups from the plan. The one that I took was mapped directly to this part of the plan: *“It’s still important for bulls to hold the line at* ***4506*** *and I would look for a recovery of the level from below”*. Right after CPI was released, the market put in a quick auction down to major support at **4494** and then recovered **4506**. I entered here and exited the majority of the trade at the next level at **4518**. I left a runner to get taken out by a trailing stop. 

As I often do, I switched to paper trading and traded three other scenarios from the plan, each of which set up perfectly: 1) The short from **4518** down to **4506**; 2) Support at **4483**, exiting at **4494**; 3) Support at **4494** and exiting at **4506**.

***Balance/Trend***: The market remains in a trend down over the past week or so and we have now seen a 160-point selloff from the recent peak at about **4635.** The market is now in a broadening pattern described below, but the most recent action has certainly been down. The market is now hovering at the inner bound of the aqua trendline channel, but the lows at **4458** need to hold if this trend is to stay.

***Analysis***: The market tested **4494** (and surrounding levels) on six separate occasions over the last week and rallied each time to about **4545**, creating what appears to be a broadening descending wedge pattern with the red line as resistance and the lower dotted black line as support. If anybody knows more about this pattern, please chime in. The market is still filling it out and statistically, usually sees a breakout to the upside and continuation. Inside of this pattern, there is a lot of volatility (that’s what created it) and so we may still see these swings up and down while the market finds its footing. Today’s close near the lows are not exactly encouraging, but with more important data ahead tomorrow, we have to wait to see if this means anything.

***Levels***

* Potential support: **4475-78**, **4466-69, 4458, 4449, 4438, 4411**

1697376982.0,StockMarket,SP500 Technical Analysis & Trading Plan for 10/16/23,"*I share my plan for discussion or education and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas.*

***Recap***: Another day of enormous intraday volatility with a 40+ point climb into the open followed by a nearly 70-point drop. In the plan for Friday I said that “***4396-4400*** *still mark a pivot, with longs above targeting a move back to* ***4419*** *and shorts below it targeting* ***4380*** *and* ***4367”***. There was not a trigger for a long, but once the consumer sentiment reading came in there was a strong rejection to enter short. I reduced my risk quite a bit due to the market still being in very choppy territory but was able to short this at 4388 down to 4380. The market continued along to the next target at 4367 and then several others.

***Balance/Trend***: The market spent the majority of the week between **4357-4419**, the balance zone, making backtests to the old balance range between **4300-4357** and then settling right at that divider level. Importantly for bulls, they held the yellow trend channel marked in yellow after recovering it last Friday and will need to continue to hold the market above **4334-36** to avoid losing the year old rising channel. There’s been a cap on the market at **4419** since September 21st but it’s been tested on numerous occasions now. Breaking through it could spark a trend leg higher while losing that yellow support level could be an indication that the next leg is down.

***Analysis***: The market has now eked out a tiny gain for the second week in a row despite pretty large intraday swings. Friday’s settlement price at **4357.25** means that the market stayed outside of the previous balance zone, and holding this level is a positive for bulls after the Friday selloff. The last line of defense for bulls is at the trend line at **4334**, or **4323** at the lowest. Any breakdowns there would make this recent trend recovery look like a failure and could spark a deep selloff that retraces the rest of this strong, \~180 point rally.

* Potential supports: **4357, 4353, 4334-36, 4321-23, 4309, 4301, 4289, 4265, 4250-56**

1600719558.0,StockMarket,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Sept 21, 2020. Enjoy!"," **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 21, 2020**

Stocks continued sinking Monday, with the three major indexes extending last week’s declines. The drop continued as traders became concerned with stagnating improvement in coronavirus cases and political uncertainty, with the US presidential election around 6 weeks out. The Dow fell the hardest today, finishing 1.84% down, the Nasdaq finished 0.39% up, and the SPY was 1.07% down.

Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research said, “The root causes of the recent drawdown in US large caps are \[first\], recent weakness in real-time economic indicators, \[second\] the lack of movement on a fiscal stimulus package that could offset #1 and \[third\] the Fed’s lackluster forecasts in its Wednesday release of the Summary of Economic Projections”.

Shares of major bank stocks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), HSBC (HSBC) and Deutsche Bank (DB) fell following a report that they and other financial institutions for decades facilitated fund transactions used for allegedly criminal activities, and failed to report suspicious activity. The report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found five global banks moved ""staggering sums of illicit cash for shadowy characters and criminal networks that have spread chaos and undermined democracy around the world."" The report cited documents leaked by BuzzFeed News that identified more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions’ internal compliance officers as possible money laundering or other criminal activity, including $514 billion at JPMorgan and $1.3 trillion at Deutsche Bank.

“Reopening stocks”, or stocks benefits when the economy looks like it will reopen soon amid the pandemic, fell steeply today, as fear over coronavirus cases here and abroad led to fear of more business closure. In the US, there are now, sadly, 200,000 deaths and new cases have risen in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota, per Yahoo Finance. WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic and that a ‘very serious situation is unfolding in Europe”. Cruise stock Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) fell more than 7% in intraday trading, and airlines including United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) and Delta (DAL) were each down at least 6%.

**Highlights**

* After opening the day deep in the red, tech stocks like $AAPL, $AMZN, and $MSFT rallied in the last hour to end firmly green or modestly red.
* Tesla (TSLA)  will likely partner with a Canadian mining company, Giga Metals Corp. (OTCQB:HNCKF) to source Nickel. Company claims it can source it in an environmentally friendly way. Battery day is tomorrow, we expect big things!
* London Mayor exploring new plans to enforce new restrictions to slow spread of virus in lieu of vaccine and more widespread testing possibilities. - Reuters**:** Alex Zukin upgraded Oracle from Sector Perform to Outperform and raised the price target from $60 to $68, calling the TikTok deal a ‘shot in the arm’.
* Shares of Nikola (NKLA) fell sharply after it was announced that Trevor Milton, Executive Chairman and Founder, stepped away from the company in lieu of Hindenburg's allegations
* $MSFT acquired ZeniMAx Media, parent company of Bethesda studios, the creators of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls series, in a $7.5 billion deal.
* Walmart (VVPR) has just announced doubling down on addressing climate crisis issues. It is targeting zero emissions across its global operation by 2040.
* Vivo Power (VVPR) signed Letter of Intent to acquire 51% stake in Tembo, a dutch 4X4 EV manufacturer.

#[Stock futures rise Friday as Dow tries to build on this week's record-setting rally: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures climbed on Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average looked to add to this week’s gains, which have led the 30-stock average to all-time highs.
*****
> Dow futures rose by 65 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures inched up 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%.
*****
> Stocks could see volatile trading as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 go through their respective quarterly rebalances. Once complete, Uber will be part of the S&P 500, and DoorDash and MongoDB will be added to the Nasdaq-100.One concern for this rebalancing is some stocks could end up having outsized weighting going on the indexes.
*****
> The major averages are headed for their seventh straight positive week. As of Thursday, the Dow is higher on the week by 2.8%. The S&P 500 is up by 2.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5% this week. It would also mark the S&P 500′s seventh straight weekly gain, its longest winning streak since 2017. The Dow is also on pace for a nine-week winning streak, its longest run since 2019.
*****
> The S&P 500 could soon join the Dow with its own all-time high. The broad market index is less than 1.6% away from a record close set in January 2022. The Nasdaq is roughly 8% away from its highest-ever close, and about 9% from its all-time intraday high.
*****
> Stocks rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week’s cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing.
*****
> “What we heard from Fed Chair Powell was that it’s not about the economy, it’s not about financial conditions, it’s not about the jobs market. It’s about inflation and inflation have been coming down pretty far and fast,” Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Thursday.
*****
> “And if we’re at a point where inflation is 2.7%, by March, that consensus is expecting interest rates are still at 5.5%,” Amoroso added. “That’s a big gap that the Fed can do something about, meaning cutting rates.”
*****
> Treasury yields dropped this week. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to below 4% after topping 5% in October.

#[Stock futures rise Friday as Dow tries to build on this week's record-setting rally: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures climbed on Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average looked to add to this week’s gains, which have led the 30-stock average to all-time highs.
*****
> Dow futures rose by 65 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures inched up 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%.
*****
> Stocks could see volatile trading as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 go through their respective quarterly rebalances. Once complete, Uber will be part of the S&P 500, and DoorDash and MongoDB will be added to the Nasdaq-100.One concern for this rebalancing is some stocks could end up having outsized weighting going on the indexes.
*****
> The major averages are headed for their seventh straight positive week. As of Thursday, the Dow is higher on the week by 2.8%. The S&P 500 is up by 2.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5% this week. It would also mark the S&P 500′s seventh straight weekly gain, its longest winning streak since 2017. The Dow is also on pace for a nine-week winning streak, its longest run since 2019.
*****
> The S&P 500 could soon join the Dow with its own all-time high. The broad market index is less than 1.6% away from a record close set in January 2022. The Nasdaq is roughly 8% away from its highest-ever close, and about 9% from its all-time intraday high.
*****
> Stocks rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week’s cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing.
*****
> “What we heard from Fed Chair Powell was that it’s not about the economy, it’s not about financial conditions, it’s not about the jobs market. It’s about inflation and inflation have been coming down pretty far and fast,” Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Thursday.
*****
> “And if we’re at a point where inflation is 2.7%, by March, that consensus is expecting interest rates are still at 5.5%,” Amoroso added. “That’s a big gap that the Fed can do something about, meaning cutting rates.”
*****
> Treasury yields dropped this week. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to below 4% after topping 5% in October.

1694028347.0,StockMarket,Need help. Difference between the realized return and the unrealized return.,"I am new to the stock market. I need some help in understanding the difference between realized and unrealized profits.

According to what I have understood, as long as I hold my shares, whatever gain I make on my shares is the unrealized return. And I am not paying any taxes on this.

An unrealized return is converted into a realized return after selling off my shares. And I am supposed to pay taxes on this. Is this correct?

I purchased some shares a few months ago and my app statement shows >>>> ***(this is an example)***

realized return = - 1000 (negative)

unrealized return = + 31,000 (positive)

**So based on this data, am I doing good or bad?** 

I am confused. I searched on the internet and somewhere I found that the realized return is the actual return that I will get if I decide to sell my shares. So, which information is correct? Because based on this information my net return would be negative 1000, even though my profit is 54%. I am confused. 

I am having a similar negative realized return but a positive unrealized return on my other shares as well. I did some intraday trading earlier but stopped and focused on the cash buy.

1393299765.0,StockMarket,"Stocks I'm watching tomorrow, 2/25/14!","Hi everyone,

Nice day in the markets today with SPY breaking out to new highs. As I expected though, the rally was a bit too strong going into the high break so it faded into the close. Healthy action from here would be some sideways movement or a slight pullback, maybe to the 182 area on SPY. I had a nice day getting used to my new platform (damn this sucker is fast!) with 5/5 wins and netting about [100 bucks in gains](http://i.imgur.com/vtLsRmn.png) (free commission promotion FTW!) I traded very small as I did not want to get caught w/ my pants down w/ learning a new piece of software but I'll start sizing up over the course of the week and hopefully be back in full swing by next week. Here are some of my favorites for tomorrow:

* NVAX long over $6. I was actually in this today at $5.97 but ended up selling flat when it started to break down intraday. I will probably revisit it tomorrow and maybe hold for a swing toward $7. 

* HW long for a flag break over $13.18 - still watching this one as it has a similar look to HZNP which turned into a nice 10-12% gain for me. I have an alert set at $13 but will probably not enter it there unless it shows serious strength. Otherwise I will wait til over $13.18 

* BWP short under today's low or on a bounce to $12.90 area. Tried to short this today but couldn't get shares so I will try calling in premarket tomorrow and see if they can locate some for me. 

* KNDI long for a continuation on news that they are expanding electric car rental services into Beijing

* CTIC long over $3.60 for a range break. This looked strong today with pretty nice volume. Target $3.80-4.00 then swing to new highs. 

* SZYM long over $12.00 for a continuation. $12.00 has historically been a big level for this stock and on momentum it could be significant. Alert at $11.98

* GALT long over $15.65 - this is a wild stock so be cautious. Looks like it is setting up for another rip like my **[first call](http://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1xh2un/stocks_im_watching_tomorrow_21014/)** over $14.20 which ran to almost $17 in one day. If it goes this week I expect $18+

I'm also watching BBRY thanks to /u/irishguy317 who called it today. Looks good for a continuation over $10.10 maybe. Alright that's all! We've started to get some good discussions going in these threads lately and I'm pumped to see so many active traders and people taking my ideas and using them to make $$$! Let me know if you've got anything on your lists!

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023.

# **Dow, Nasdaq close higher Friday, extending rally to a seventh winning week: Live updates- [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher Friday after a whipsaw session, where it marked a fresh intraday record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 closed at a record high, as Wall Street pushed both major indexes to their seventh-straight winning week.
*****
> The Dow closed up 56 points, or 0.2%, at 37,305.16. The S&P 500 slipped 36 points, or 0.01%, to 4,719.19 while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 52 points, or 0.4% at 14,813.92. The Nasdaq-100 broke above 16,573.34, a record closing high reached in November 2021.
*****
> Shares of Costco ended the day up 4.5% after hitting an all-time high during the session. The retailer surpassed Wall Street’s estimates for quarterly results and issued a dividend of $15 per share.
*****
> Both the 30-stock Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq notched their seventh straight positive week. As of Friday, the Dow is higher on the month by 3.7%. The S&P 500 is up by 3.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4.2% so far in December. The S&P 500′s close brought the index just shy of its seventh straight weekly gain, which would have marked its longest winning streak since 2017. The S&P 500 could still soon join the Dow with its own all-time high, however, as the broad market index is less than 2% away from a record close set in January 2022.
*****
> Wall Street rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week’s cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing.
*****
> That said, New York Fed President John Williams pushed back on the euphoria around the central bank easing rates next year. “We aren’t really talking about rate cuts right now,” Williams told CNBC’s Steve Liesman in an interview on Friday.
*****
> “Stocks got a major sentiment boost from Wednesday’s Fed meeting, but that immediate effect was bound to wear off,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade. “The market doesn’t go up every day, no matter how strong a trend is. Pullbacks and pauses are inevitable, regardless of how big they are or how long they last.”

> # Magnificent Seven Market Cap Round Trip

> At the start of 2022, the seven largest S&P 500 stocks by market cap (which have begun to colloquially be called the Magnificent Seven) possessed a combined market cap of $11.78 trillion. However, severe losses throughout 2022 meant that by the end of the year these stocks were down 47.7% on average. In terms of the combined market cap, that dropped the total down to just $6.9 trillion. In 2023, those same seven stocks have averaged a gain of 106.6%. While not all of these stocks have fully recovered—for example, Telsa (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) all have lower market caps than at the start of 2022—the strong performance this year on the whole has meant the combined market cap has made a round trip. Now back to square one, what’s next?

> # All About Dow New Highs

> In the face of many worries, stocks have put together a historic year in ’23. To top things off, the Dow just hit a fresh new all-time high, its first new high since January 4, 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-1-2.png))**

> **New Highs Happen More Than You Think**
Interestingly, this marked the 11th consecutive year that the Dow made a new high, the second longest streak ever! Of course, the previous two calendar years have had a total of only four new highs, but it still counts.

> Since 1900 there have been nearly 1,400 new highs, which actually comes out to 4.5% of all days since 1900 closing at a new all-time high. That is probably much more than most people expect.

> **Stocks Lead the Economy**
> Since markets are forward looking, stocks tend to lead the economy. This can work on the way up and way down, so for us new highs right now is suggesting the economy is on firm footing heading into ’24 and a stronger economy (with no recession) could be the play next year.

> Sure, there are always some examples of that ‘final new high’ right before trouble (1929, 2000, and 2007), but looking back at history, new highs rarely suggest impending doom right around the corner.

> Since World War II, there were 227 months that saw at least one new high for the Dow. A recession started within a year of one of those months only 26 times, or 11.5% of the time. Compare this with the economy being in a recession 13.9% of the time since WWII and new highs could be a subtle positive sign for the economy next year.

> The last new high for the Dow was nearly two years ago, so what happens after the Dow goes a long time without new high? I found 12 times since WWII it went at least a full year without a new high and then made one, and only twice did the economy fall into a recession within a year of that new high.

> What stood out about those two times was both saw Middle East turmoil and a spike in crude oil, likely contributing to the recession. Given the US now produces more oil than anyone, does it makes sense to bet against history and treat this new high as an exception? Here’s a tweet I sent on this idea.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-3-2.png))**

> **Now What?**
> Plain and simple, new highs aren’t bearish events. In fact, you tend to see new highs take place during bull markets, with more advances potentially ahead. We’ve been calling this a new bull market for over a year now. As far back as last November we said the lows were in and there would be no recession in 2023 (with many arguing with us the whole way up).

> In fact, here’s an interview I did six months ago with Scott Wapner on CNBC’s Closing Bell. When he asked me what my biggest worry was, I said it was that too many people were bearish and weren’t embracing this bull market.

> So what do new highs mean by the numbers? By itself, a new high doesn’t appear to signal any warnings. In fact, things look about average after new highs. There are the nearly 1,400 new highs since 1900 and a year later the Dow was up 7.8% on average and higher 70.2% of the time. Compare this with the average year since 1900, which was up 7.4% on average and higher 65% of the time.

> But the Dow’s long break without a new high until now improves the outlook historically. Looking at those 12 times (since WWII) the Dow went at least one year without a new high and then finally made one, ol’ Papa Dow was higher a year later 10 times and up an average of 14.1% with a very solid median return of 16.4%.

> # Wealth Effect Picks Up Into Christmas

> With just two weekends left to shop before Christmas, US consumers have to be feeling a little more flush than they were just a couple months ago. Back in October, the stock market was in a 10%+ drawdown and interest rates looked like they might never stop going up. Less than two months later, though, the S&P 500 Total Return index is suddenly trading at all-time highs as Treasury yields have plummeted.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/totalreturn1215.png))**

> Maybe just as important for that ""wealth effect"" feeling is the huge drop in gas prices that we've seen since late September. Back on September 17th, AAA's national average gas price reading (the cost of a gallon of regular unleaded) hit a 52-week high of $3.88. In the three months since then, there has hardly been a day when gas prices haven't gone down, and just yesterday the price/gallon ticked down to $3.087. That drop took gas prices below the low of $3.096 seen last December 22nd to their lowest levels in more than two and a half years dating back to 6/24/21.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/gallongas.png))**

> With the stock market at new highs again and gas prices suddenly approaching a ""2-handle,"" Santa may have a little more room in his gift sack this year!

> # FAANG+ Leaving Newcomers in the Dust

> Both the NYSE FAANG+ Index and Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) have put in place fresh 52-week highs in the past couple of days, however, zooming out, those fresh highs are on different planets. The NYSE FAANG+ index—comprised of many mega cap Tech stocks—is not only at a 52-week high, but it's trading at record highs. Since the pre-COVID market high in February 2020, the FANG+ group is now up 120.1%. As for the IPO ETF, this week's 52-week high only leaves the group at the highest levels since April 2022. Contrary to the all-time high for FAANG+, IPO is still down 51.7% from its February 2021 high and is up a meager 4.7% since pre-COVID. As you can see below, these two traded closely inline with each other in the early days of the post-COVID rally, but FANG+ has left IPO in the dust since the start of 2022.

> # Bulls Take the Majority

> More and more equity indices are hitting fresh record highs with the S&P 500 within 1.5% of doing the same. Understandably on these moves, investor sentiment has gotten a further boost. Per the latest AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, 51.3% of investors reported as bullish this week. And keep in mind, due to the timing of the survey, that would not have fully captured any investor response to yesterday's FOMC. That is the highest and first reading above 50% since July 20th of this year when bulls were only 0.1 percentage points higher. Outside of that week, it would be the highest bullish sentiment reading since April 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-1.png))**

> Given the new high in bulls, bears have been nowhere to be found. A meager 19.3% of respondents reported as bearish this week. That surpasses the recent low of 19.6% from just two weeks ago for the lowest amount since the first week of January 2018 when only 15.56% of responses were bearish.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-2.png))**

> The overwhelmingly bullish sentiment can also be observed through the bull-bear spread. Currently, the share of bulls outnumber bears by 32 percentage points. That is the widest margin in favor of bulls since April 2021. Looked at another way, that is 2.1 standard deviations above the historical average of the spread meaning sentiment is extremely extended..

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-3.png))**

> The cheery sentiment on the part of investors certainly means there is a warm and fuzzy feeling during this holiday season, but we would note that sentiment is historically a contrarian indicator. In other words, opposite to what investors are feeling, extremely bullish sentiment readings have historically been followed by more lackluster returns.

> # Claims Cooling Down

> Economic data this morning broadly came in healthier than expected, including weekly jobless claims. Initial claims were expected to go unchanged at 220K. While that previous week's reading was revised up to 221K, this week's print fell all the way down to 202K. That is the lowest reading on jobless claims since the week of October 14th and September 16th before that. In all, that makes for one of the lowest readings on claims since January of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-1.png))**

> Before seasonal adjustment, claims are largely following the usual seasonal pattern having been trending higher since the early fall. Currently at 248.3K, unadjusted claims are running at the lowest level for the comparable week of the year since 1969.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-2.png))**

> Continuing claims have gotten much more elevated than initial claims over the past few months. Currently totaling 1.876 million, continuing claims have risen meaningfully from the low of 1.658 million put in place just three months ago. However, the consistent pace of increases over that span (every week from September 16th through the first week of November saw a week over week increase) has slowed, having been more choppy in the past month. In fact, at 1.876 million, the current reading is still almost 50K below the recent high of 1.925 million set in mid-November.

> # Moderating Inflation & Final Fed Meeting Clear Path for late-December Surge

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ef864c3f84106395bbfd2b61bd54035c/858694959f22126f-96/s500x750/a55689a0153a6b79ad518fa46fcda7cf02675b2f.jpg))**

> This week’s CPI and PPI releases showed the moderating trend of inflation continues. Prices are still rising just at a slower pace and the rate of change could finally fall back before the Fed’s target of 2% next year. In response to and in anticipation of lower interest rates, the market has enjoyed above average gains in December.

> As of the close on December 12, DJIA was up 1.74%, S&P 500 +1.66%, NASDAQ +2.16% and Russell 2000 up an impressive 3.99% (right side vertical axis of chart above). The market did experience some typical early December weakness this year after bucking the trend of weakness on the first trading day. Even though the market has already enjoyed above average gains this month, we still anticipate more to come with the potential for a new all-time closing high from DJIA before year end.

> # Inflation Still Moving in the Right Direction

> This morning’s Consumer Price Index for November was mostly in line with expectations (although the headline reading was slightly higher than expected), and the lack of any meaningful surprises has allowed the market to continue with what has lately been the path of least resistance, which has been higher. The report also showed that the most rapid leg of disinflation is most likely behind us, and while that could lead some to believe that the road ahead will be a slog, that isn’t necessarily the case.

> For starters, the focus of monthly inflation reports lately has been in Core CPI (ex-food and energy). After peaking at 6.6% in June 2022, the November year/year reading came in at 4.0% for the second month in a row.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI.png))**

> The chart below shows the historical 12-month rate of change in the y/y core CPI. Over the last 12 months, that rate of increase has declined by two full percentage points, and outside of the prior two months, that is one of the sharpest declines since the early 1980s. In other words, the 12-month rate of change is still declining, but the pace of decline is slowing.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-One-Year-Change.png))**

> November’s streak also ended what has been a monumental streak of monthly declines in the y/y core CPI reading. At seven months in October, it was the second longest streak on record, trailing only the ten-month streak of declines ending in December 1975.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-Declines-Streaks.png))**

> Understandably, the end of the streak of declines along with the slowing rate of decline in the y/y core CPI reading could lead one to think that inflation levels are plateauing at a higher level. However, a look at the trend of monthly prints in core CPI shows a potential tailwind in the months ahead. The chart below shows the monthly change in core CPI over the last 24 months. While it hasn’t exactly been linear, the trend is lower. In the twelve months from December 2021 through November 2022, eight out of twelve monthly prints were 0.5% or above, but in the last twelve months, only one print has been 0.5%.

> Just looking at the last year (shaded area in chart) it’s a similar trend. From December 2022 through May 2022, every monthly print was 0.4% or above, but in the most recent six months, every print has been 0.3% or below. If just the trend of the last six months remains in place, for the next six months the y/y reading will be replacing monthly prints of 0.4% or more with prints of 0.3% or less which should help to keep the trend of disinflation going.

> # Small Business Sentiment Mixed Under the Hood

> The NFIB unveiled its latest look at small business sentiment early this morning. The headline number remains in the bottom decile of its historical range, falling 0.1 points to 90.6 in November. That is compared to expectations which called for the number to be unchanged last month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-1.png))**

> Across the categories factoring into the index, breadth was mixed in November with four categories falling, four rising, and one unchanged. Like the headline number, many categories are also in the bottom few percentiles of their respective historical ranges, albeit with some exceptions like robust readings in plans to increase employment, current inventories, and job openings hard to fill.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-2.png))**

> As we discussed in our Morning Lineup, combining the report's readings on employment shows some rebounding conditions for labor markets over the past few months. Looking more closely, though, it is hard to say labor market conditions are materially accelerating. As shown, hiring plans have risen, but on net more companies are reporting negative employment changes. In a similar vein, compensation plans have risen sharply including a six point jump month over month in November (the largest one month increase since last October and the third largest on record), even though actual changes to compensation have been flat. Meanwhile, fewer businesses are reporting job openings are hard to fill. Small businesses are showing labor conditions have cooled over the past couple of years but are far from weak as any more recent improvements have been from plans rather than observed changes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-4.png))**

> Similarly, sales expectations rebounded in November, contrary to a flat reading on actual sales and earnings changes. Perhaps most importantly, the share of businesses reporting higher prices has fallen down to 25, matching the July low. In combination with the higher reading on sales expectations, that likely helped the number of firms reporting now as a good time to expand.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5.png))**

> Looking at the reverse, of those reporting now as not a good time to expand, the single biggest reason given for such sentiment was economic conditions. That is typically the most widely cited reason historically followed by political climate (the NFIB has a tendency to be sensitive to politics, namely which party holds the presidency), but for the first time in at least a decade, financial conditions and interest rates earned the number two spot. As shown below, the number of firms reporting that rates are holding them back from expanding has risen steadily since the current tightening cycle began.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-6b.png))**

> As mentioned previously, actual earnings changes saw no improvement in November and are sitting near historically weak levels. As for the reasons given for lower earnings, increased costs remain a key reason, but November also saw a significant jump in those reporting sales volumes as a problem. In other words, inflation and weaker demand appear to be weighing on small business earnings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5a.png))**

> Despite the burden of interest rates and expectations for credit conditions sitting at the lowest levels in over a decade, small businesses have actually increased capital expenditures dramatically to a new post-pandemic high. However, that is counter to capital expenditure plans, which have fallen in the past few months, and inventories showing drawdowns.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",12,2,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023 Good Friday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023.

# **Dow, Nasdaq close higher Friday, extending rally to a seventh winning week: Live updates- [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher Friday after a whipsaw session, where it marked a fresh intraday record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 closed at a record high, as Wall Street pushed both major indexes to their seventh-straight winning week.
*****
> The Dow closed up 56 points, or 0.2%, at 37,305.16. The S&P 500 slipped 36 points, or 0.01%, to 4,719.19 while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 52 points, or 0.4% at 14,813.92. The Nasdaq-100 broke above 16,573.34, a record closing high reached in November 2021.
*****
> Shares of Costco ended the day up 4.5% after hitting an all-time high during the session. The retailer surpassed Wall Street’s estimates for quarterly results and issued a dividend of $15 per share.
*****
> Both the 30-stock Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq notched their seventh straight positive week. As of Friday, the Dow is higher on the month by 3.7%. The S&P 500 is up by 3.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4.2% so far in December. The S&P 500′s close brought the index just shy of its seventh straight weekly gain, which would have marked its longest winning streak since 2017. The S&P 500 could still soon join the Dow with its own all-time high, however, as the broad market index is less than 2% away from a record close set in January 2022.
*****
> Wall Street rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week’s cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing.
*****
> That said, New York Fed President John Williams pushed back on the euphoria around the central bank easing rates next year. “We aren’t really talking about rate cuts right now,” Williams told CNBC’s Steve Liesman in an interview on Friday.
*****
> “Stocks got a major sentiment boost from Wednesday’s Fed meeting, but that immediate effect was bound to wear off,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade. “The market doesn’t go up every day, no matter how strong a trend is. Pullbacks and pauses are inevitable, regardless of how big they are or how long they last.”

> # Magnificent Seven Market Cap Round Trip

> At the start of 2022, the seven largest S&P 500 stocks by market cap (which have begun to colloquially be called the Magnificent Seven) possessed a combined market cap of $11.78 trillion. However, severe losses throughout 2022 meant that by the end of the year these stocks were down 47.7% on average. In terms of the combined market cap, that dropped the total down to just $6.9 trillion. In 2023, those same seven stocks have averaged a gain of 106.6%. While not all of these stocks have fully recovered—for example, Telsa (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) all have lower market caps than at the start of 2022—the strong performance this year on the whole has meant the combined market cap has made a round trip. Now back to square one, what’s next?

> **Now What?**
> Plain and simple, new highs aren’t bearish events. In fact, you tend to see new highs take place during bull markets, with more advances potentially ahead. We’ve been calling this a new bull market for over a year now. As far back as last November we said the lows were in and there would be no recession in 2023 (with many arguing with us the whole way up).

> In fact, here’s an interview I did six months ago with Scott Wapner on CNBC’s Closing Bell. When he asked me what my biggest worry was, I said it was that too many people were bearish and weren’t embracing this bull market.

> So what do new highs mean by the numbers? By itself, a new high doesn’t appear to signal any warnings. In fact, things look about average after new highs. There are the nearly 1,400 new highs since 1900 and a year later the Dow was up 7.8% on average and higher 70.2% of the time. Compare this with the average year since 1900, which was up 7.4% on average and higher 65% of the time.

> But the Dow’s long break without a new high until now improves the outlook historically. Looking at those 12 times (since WWII) the Dow went at least one year without a new high and then finally made one, ol’ Papa Dow was higher a year later 10 times and up an average of 14.1% with a very solid median return of 16.4%.

> # Wealth Effect Picks Up Into Christmas

> With just two weekends left to shop before Christmas, US consumers have to be feeling a little more flush than they were just a couple months ago. Back in October, the stock market was in a 10%+ drawdown and interest rates looked like they might never stop going up. Less than two months later, though, the S&P 500 Total Return index is suddenly trading at all-time highs as Treasury yields have plummeted.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/totalreturn1215.png))**

> Maybe just as important for that ""wealth effect"" feeling is the huge drop in gas prices that we've seen since late September. Back on September 17th, AAA's national average gas price reading (the cost of a gallon of regular unleaded) hit a 52-week high of $3.88. In the three months since then, there has hardly been a day when gas prices haven't gone down, and just yesterday the price/gallon ticked down to $3.087. That drop took gas prices below the low of $3.096 seen last December 22nd to their lowest levels in more than two and a half years dating back to 6/24/21.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/gallongas.png))**

> With the stock market at new highs again and gas prices suddenly approaching a ""2-handle,"" Santa may have a little more room in his gift sack this year!

> # FAANG+ Leaving Newcomers in the Dust

> Both the NYSE FAANG+ Index and Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) have put in place fresh 52-week highs in the past couple of days, however, zooming out, those fresh highs are on different planets. The NYSE FAANG+ index—comprised of many mega cap Tech stocks—is not only at a 52-week high, but it's trading at record highs. Since the pre-COVID market high in February 2020, the FANG+ group is now up 120.1%. As for the IPO ETF, this week's 52-week high only leaves the group at the highest levels since April 2022. Contrary to the all-time high for FAANG+, IPO is still down 51.7% from its February 2021 high and is up a meager 4.7% since pre-COVID. As you can see below, these two traded closely inline with each other in the early days of the post-COVID rally, but FANG+ has left IPO in the dust since the start of 2022.

> # Bulls Take the Majority

> More and more equity indices are hitting fresh record highs with the S&P 500 within 1.5% of doing the same. Understandably on these moves, investor sentiment has gotten a further boost. Per the latest AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, 51.3% of investors reported as bullish this week. And keep in mind, due to the timing of the survey, that would not have fully captured any investor response to yesterday's FOMC. That is the highest and first reading above 50% since July 20th of this year when bulls were only 0.1 percentage points higher. Outside of that week, it would be the highest bullish sentiment reading since April 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-1.png))**

> Given the new high in bulls, bears have been nowhere to be found. A meager 19.3% of respondents reported as bearish this week. That surpasses the recent low of 19.6% from just two weeks ago for the lowest amount since the first week of January 2018 when only 15.56% of responses were bearish.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-2.png))**

> The overwhelmingly bullish sentiment can also be observed through the bull-bear spread. Currently, the share of bulls outnumber bears by 32 percentage points. That is the widest margin in favor of bulls since April 2021. Looked at another way, that is 2.1 standard deviations above the historical average of the spread meaning sentiment is extremely extended..

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-3.png))**

> The cheery sentiment on the part of investors certainly means there is a warm and fuzzy feeling during this holiday season, but we would note that sentiment is historically a contrarian indicator. In other words, opposite to what investors are feeling, extremely bullish sentiment readings have historically been followed by more lackluster returns.

> # Claims Cooling Down

> Economic data this morning broadly came in healthier than expected, including weekly jobless claims. Initial claims were expected to go unchanged at 220K. While that previous week's reading was revised up to 221K, this week's print fell all the way down to 202K. That is the lowest reading on jobless claims since the week of October 14th and September 16th before that. In all, that makes for one of the lowest readings on claims since January of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-1.png))**

> Before seasonal adjustment, claims are largely following the usual seasonal pattern having been trending higher since the early fall. Currently at 248.3K, unadjusted claims are running at the lowest level for the comparable week of the year since 1969.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-2.png))**

> Continuing claims have gotten much more elevated than initial claims over the past few months. Currently totaling 1.876 million, continuing claims have risen meaningfully from the low of 1.658 million put in place just three months ago. However, the consistent pace of increases over that span (every week from September 16th through the first week of November saw a week over week increase) has slowed, having been more choppy in the past month. In fact, at 1.876 million, the current reading is still almost 50K below the recent high of 1.925 million set in mid-November.

> # Moderating Inflation & Final Fed Meeting Clear Path for late-December Surge

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ef864c3f84106395bbfd2b61bd54035c/858694959f22126f-96/s500x750/a55689a0153a6b79ad518fa46fcda7cf02675b2f.jpg))**

> This week’s CPI and PPI releases showed the moderating trend of inflation continues. Prices are still rising just at a slower pace and the rate of change could finally fall back before the Fed’s target of 2% next year. In response to and in anticipation of lower interest rates, the market has enjoyed above average gains in December.

> As of the close on December 12, DJIA was up 1.74%, S&P 500 +1.66%, NASDAQ +2.16% and Russell 2000 up an impressive 3.99% (right side vertical axis of chart above). The market did experience some typical early December weakness this year after bucking the trend of weakness on the first trading day. Even though the market has already enjoyed above average gains this month, we still anticipate more to come with the potential for a new all-time closing high from DJIA before year end.

> # Inflation Still Moving in the Right Direction

> This morning’s Consumer Price Index for November was mostly in line with expectations (although the headline reading was slightly higher than expected), and the lack of any meaningful surprises has allowed the market to continue with what has lately been the path of least resistance, which has been higher. The report also showed that the most rapid leg of disinflation is most likely behind us, and while that could lead some to believe that the road ahead will be a slog, that isn’t necessarily the case.

> For starters, the focus of monthly inflation reports lately has been in Core CPI (ex-food and energy). After peaking at 6.6% in June 2022, the November year/year reading came in at 4.0% for the second month in a row.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI.png))**

> The chart below shows the historical 12-month rate of change in the y/y core CPI. Over the last 12 months, that rate of increase has declined by two full percentage points, and outside of the prior two months, that is one of the sharpest declines since the early 1980s. In other words, the 12-month rate of change is still declining, but the pace of decline is slowing.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-One-Year-Change.png))**

> November’s streak also ended what has been a monumental streak of monthly declines in the y/y core CPI reading. At seven months in October, it was the second longest streak on record, trailing only the ten-month streak of declines ending in December 1975.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-Declines-Streaks.png))**

> Understandably, the end of the streak of declines along with the slowing rate of decline in the y/y core CPI reading could lead one to think that inflation levels are plateauing at a higher level. However, a look at the trend of monthly prints in core CPI shows a potential tailwind in the months ahead. The chart below shows the monthly change in core CPI over the last 24 months. While it hasn’t exactly been linear, the trend is lower. In the twelve months from December 2021 through November 2022, eight out of twelve monthly prints were 0.5% or above, but in the last twelve months, only one print has been 0.5%.

> Just looking at the last year (shaded area in chart) it’s a similar trend. From December 2022 through May 2022, every monthly print was 0.4% or above, but in the most recent six months, every print has been 0.3% or below. If just the trend of the last six months remains in place, for the next six months the y/y reading will be replacing monthly prints of 0.4% or more with prints of 0.3% or less which should help to keep the trend of disinflation going.

> # Small Business Sentiment Mixed Under the Hood

> The NFIB unveiled its latest look at small business sentiment early this morning. The headline number remains in the bottom decile of its historical range, falling 0.1 points to 90.6 in November. That is compared to expectations which called for the number to be unchanged last month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-1.png))**

> Across the categories factoring into the index, breadth was mixed in November with four categories falling, four rising, and one unchanged. Like the headline number, many categories are also in the bottom few percentiles of their respective historical ranges, albeit with some exceptions like robust readings in plans to increase employment, current inventories, and job openings hard to fill.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-2.png))**

> As we discussed in our Morning Lineup, combining the report's readings on employment shows some rebounding conditions for labor markets over the past few months. Looking more closely, though, it is hard to say labor market conditions are materially accelerating. As shown, hiring plans have risen, but on net more companies are reporting negative employment changes. In a similar vein, compensation plans have risen sharply including a six point jump month over month in November (the largest one month increase since last October and the third largest on record), even though actual changes to compensation have been flat. Meanwhile, fewer businesses are reporting job openings are hard to fill. Small businesses are showing labor conditions have cooled over the past couple of years but are far from weak as any more recent improvements have been from plans rather than observed changes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-4.png))**

> Similarly, sales expectations rebounded in November, contrary to a flat reading on actual sales and earnings changes. Perhaps most importantly, the share of businesses reporting higher prices has fallen down to 25, matching the July low. In combination with the higher reading on sales expectations, that likely helped the number of firms reporting now as a good time to expand.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5.png))**

> Looking at the reverse, of those reporting now as not a good time to expand, the single biggest reason given for such sentiment was economic conditions. That is typically the most widely cited reason historically followed by political climate (the NFIB has a tendency to be sensitive to politics, namely which party holds the presidency), but for the first time in at least a decade, financial conditions and interest rates earned the number two spot. As shown below, the number of firms reporting that rates are holding them back from expanding has risen steadily since the current tightening cycle began.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-6b.png))**

> As mentioned previously, actual earnings changes saw no improvement in November and are sitting near historically weak levels. As for the reasons given for lower earnings, increased costs remain a key reason, but November also saw a significant jump in those reporting sales volumes as a problem. In other words, inflation and weaker demand appear to be weighing on small business earnings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5a.png))**

> Despite the burden of interest rates and expectations for credit conditions sitting at the lowest levels in over a decade, small businesses have actually increased capital expenditures dramatically to a new post-pandemic high. However, that is counter to capital expenditure plans, which have fallen in the past few months, and inventories showing drawdowns.

The stock market rose before pulling back steeply in the last hour of the session after data was released showing new weekly jobless fell more than expected, even as business content with surging coronavirus cases and the reimposition of restrictions. The S&P 500 reached an intraday record-high once again.

In good news, the UK became the first western country to grant emergency use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) and will reportedly purchase 40 million doses and expect inoculation to begin starting next week. The UK government is rolling out the vaccine in priority groups, with the elderly and healthcare professionals at the top of the list. Health Minister Matt Hancock said, “From early next week we will start the program of vaccinating people against COVID-19 in this country.” 

Unfortunately, despite the positive vaccine news, the reality is that rolling out the vaccine to the wider population is expected to take a few months. In the meantime, cases continue to surge in the United States. Dr. Robert Redford, Director of the CDC said he thinks January and February are “going to be the most difficult months in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that’s going to be put on our healthcare system”. Sadly, yesterday the US reported the worst daily death toll since the pandemic began, with more than 2,760 people dying from the virus. Experts say they expect the death toll to worsen in the coming days. To make matters worse, hospitalizations also reached an all-time high for about the 24th day in a row. As of yesterday, there were more than 100,000 patients hospitalized from coronavirus -- more than double the number of patients at the beginning of November. Compared to the first wave earlier in the year, where cases were mainly concentrated in the Northeast of the country, today the pandemic is being felt across the whole country. 

Today, the Department of Labor released its weekly unemployment report. In a positive surprise, new weekly jobless claims fell more than was expected even with the surge in coronavirus and the reimposition of stay-in-place restrictions across many states. For the week ending November 28, there were 712,000 new claims vs 775,000 expected. Continuing claims, which shows the amount of people entering their second week of jobless claims, also fell to 5.52 million vs 5.8 million estimate.

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
> Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
> Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
> Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
> The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
> The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
> Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
> “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
> Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
> “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
> The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
> During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
> Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
> While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
> Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
> Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
> “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
> Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
> Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
> Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
> The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
> The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
> Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
> “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
> Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
> “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
> The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
> During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
> Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
> While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
> Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
> Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
> “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

1706540741.0,StockMarket,These are the stocks on my watchlist (1/27),"  

No positions in any stocks long-term but FAANG/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers)

To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade.

1676797790.0,StockMarket,LASE Enters Bullish Pennant Pattern after Ripping +160% YTD,"A couple of weeks ago I shared some initial thoughts on Laser Photonics’ (NASDAQ: LASE) and its recent trajectory from a bottom of $1.50 in late December to a new ATH of $7.19, which it hit on February 3rd. In the two weeks since hitting a max that’s roughly 150% of its IPO price ($5 on 9.30.22), LASE’s price action has begun to stabilize in the $5-$5.50 range. From the looks of the chart, LASE looks to be entering a bullish pennant pattern, which means another positive breakout could be around the corner. LASE is shaping out to be my best performer YTD by a long run, and despite the triple digit gains its already racked in I believe there's more green on the way. Here’s the evidence for this play:

The first strong period of upward movement LASE saw in 2023 was driven by a clear bullish catalyst announced on January 11th, namely a 2 million share buy back. This generated trade volume of nearly 19M on the day of the announcement and a cumulative 27M volume for January overall. Likewise, intraday price action popped by ±100% on the heels of the news.

The second period of pronounced upwards movement for LASE was on February 3rd, when the company announced that it is integrating IoT functionality into its laser cleaning systems, thereby gaining exposure to one of the hottest sectors in tech today. This catalyst was both preceded and followed by similarly bullish PRs regarding upgrades to the company’s technology, product line, and renewal of regulatory approval (see captions on chart above). The market responded favorably, driving LASE to its new ATH and briefly driving RSI into overbought territory.

Since its peak on February 3rd, LASE SP has begun to come back down to earth as it consolidates within what strikes me as a clear case of a bullish pennant pattern. Look at the roughly symmetrical resistance/support lines I’ve added in white to the chart above. RSI has also re-entered fairly-valued territory, and for a YTD horizon it's currently sitting just above par, i.e. the stock is looking fairly valued. After a pullback MACD has also stabilized in the green, signifying consolidation prior to an impending bullish breakout.

A quick look at the LASE’s fundamentals and overall financial situation support the bullish breakout signals the current pennant pattern is flashing. LASE holds a first-comers advantage in the field of laser cleaning solutions, enjoys a sticky clientbook featuring US government entities and Fortune 500 companies, and can expect stable-to-positive deal flow moving forward given the relatively inelastic quality of demand for its industrial-grade product line. In terms of financials, LASE can cite positive earnings, EPS, EBITDA, and profit margin. Look at the tables below for the fuller data table:

In my eyes, LASE is a rare combination of a reliable industry that is leveraging cutting-edge technology with, at least so far, marked success.  Though I don’t have a crystal ball, I’m long on LASE and am expecting some more upward movement in the short/intermediate term on the basis of the bullish pennant pattern its price action seems to have assumed in recent weeks. Particularly if positive earnings, deal flow flow, and product/tech upgrades keep coming, the $10 PT analysts have given LASE seems within range over the course of 2023. We’ll see what the market has in store, but this all-American laser solution provider is looking increasingly attractive to me, and by the looks of it, the broader market. Full disclosure: I entered LASE for 10K at $2.00 and another 15K at $4.00, and this is NOT financial or investment advice.",51,8,"LASE Enters Bullish Pennant Pattern after Ripping +160% YTD A couple of weeks ago I shared some initial thoughts on Laser Photonics’ (NASDAQ: LASE) and its recent trajectory from a bottom of $1.50 in late December to a new ATH of $7.19, which it hit on February 3rd.

The stock market sank on Wednesday, pressured by a sell-off in technology stocks, as market participants digest the Fed’s latest meeting, which suggests an interest raise hike could happen ‘relatively soon’. As a result, growth stocks and technology stocks harshly pulled back. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a fresh intraday record high in the morning before slipping in the afternoon to close lower.

The meeting minutes from the Fed’s December monetary policy meeting suggest the Central Bank was considering accelerating the timeline for a potential interest rate hike amid strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation.

The meeting minutes said, “Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.""

Moreover, the minutes said, “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”

Here is the entire meeting minutes: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)

Treasury yields jumped to build on gains after moving sharply higher on Monday and Tuesday, which had added pressure to technology and growth stocks. The benchmark 10-year jumped to a 9-month high following the release of the Fed's meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon.

Scott Kimbal, Co-Head of Fixed Income for BMO Global Asset Management said, “Yields are moving sharply higher ... or in the very recent past, but they've been stubbornly lower when you compare them to what the inflationary talk has been. There's been lots of discussion about runaway inflation, the Fed being behind the curve. All of that would translate into a long-end — the 10, 20, 30-year portion of the yield curve — that's a lot steeper, or materially higher even in absolute terms than it is right now.""

This morning, market participants digested a fresh upbeat labor market report, which showed private payroll gains handily beat estimated for December. ADP, a leading data processing company, that private-sector employers added back 807,000 jobs during the final month of November,  well ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 375,000 and the November gain of 505,000.

Hiring was broad-based, though leisure and hospitality led with 246,000 new positions. Trade, transportation, and utilities contributed 138,000, professional and business services increased by 130,000, and education and health services added 85,000.

While service-related professions led with 669,000 new hires, the goods-producing side also showed strong gains with manufacturing rising 74,000.

Nela Richardson, Chief Economist at ADP, said “December’s job market strengthened as the fallout from the Delta variant faded and Omicron’s impact had yet to be seen. Job gains were broad-based, as goods producers added the strongest reading of the year, while service providers dominated growth.”

[https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx)

Following the ADP release, Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for the December nonfarm payrolls count to 500,000, a 50,000 increase from its prior estimate.

As I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins raising interest rates. Now that the Fed seems to be accelerating its timeline, it’s time to reassess. While I think the pullback the last two days is overdone, I do think market conditions are shifting. I remain bullish in the long-term but expect a lot more choppiness compared to the last two years. Trades should be quicker, with tighter profit targets and stops.

**Highlights**

* The Omicron variant continues to surge across the US, with the country once again recording a new record high. On January 4, the US reported 885,451 new coronavirus infections, more than tripling the peak of any of the previous surges.
* Ford Motors (F) stock recently jumped more than 10% after the company announced it planned to double production of the electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck.
* Ford also reported sales for 2021 fell 6.8% compared to 2020 but had a very strong fourth-quarter, a sign that demand could begin to pick up. Ford sold 508,451 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a 27% increase over the previous quarter
* Meta Platforms (FB) has ceased development of a new VR/AR software operating system that employed more than 300 after four years. Meta quickly issued a statement via Gabriel Aul, its vice president of Reality Labs Engineering. ""There are several technical directions we're pursuing in our efforts to build the operating systems, we're still working on a highly specialized OS for our devices - we remain very much invested in this work and continue to dedicate the resources necessary to build this.”
* GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told the annual CES technology conference via video on Wednesday that the electric Silverado will launch in two stages in 2023.
* WarnerMedia’s HBO Max streaming service gained subscribers through the holidays, defying the slowing pace of growth at some rival services

The meeting minutes from the Fed’s December monetary policy meeting suggest the Central Bank was considering accelerating the timeline for a potential interest rate hike amid strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation.

The meeting minutes said, “Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.""

Moreover, the minutes said, “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”

Here is the entire meeting minutes: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)

Treasury yields jumped to build on gains after moving sharply higher on Monday and Tuesday, which had added pressure to technology and growth stocks. The benchmark 10-year jumped to a 9-month high following the release of the Fed's meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon.

Scott Kimbal, Co-Head of Fixed Income for BMO Global Asset Management said, “Yields are moving sharply higher ... or in the very recent past, but they've been stubbornly lower when you compare them to what the inflationary talk has been. There's been lots of discussion about runaway inflation, the Fed being behind the curve. All of that would translate into a long-end — the 10, 20, 30-year portion of the yield curve — that's a lot steeper, or materially higher even in absolute terms than it is right now.""

This morning, market participants digested a fresh upbeat labor market report, which showed private payroll gains handily beat estimated for December. ADP, a leading data processing company, that private-sector employers added back 807,000 jobs during the final month of November,  well ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 375,000 and the November gain of 505,000.

Hiring was broad-based, though leisure and hospitality led with 246,000 new positions. Trade, transportation, and utilities contributed 138,000, professional and business services increased by 130,000, and education and health services added 85,000.

While service-related professions led with 669,000 new hires, the goods-producing side also showed strong gains with manufacturing rising 74,000.

Nela Richardson, Chief Economist at ADP, said “December’s job market strengthened as the fallout from the Delta variant faded and Omicron’s impact had yet to be seen. Job gains were broad-based, as goods producers added the strongest reading of the year, while service providers dominated growth.”

Following the ADP release, Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for the December nonfarm payrolls count to 500,000, a 50,000 increase from its prior estimate.

As I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins raising interest rates. Now that the Fed seems to be accelerating its timeline, it’s time to reassess. While I think the pullback the last two days is overdone, I do think market conditions are shifting. I remain bullish in the long-term but expect a lot more choppiness compared to the last two years. Trades should be quicker, with tighter profit targets and stops.

Stocks performed mixed today, with the S&P and Dow Jones pulling back while the tech-heavy Nasdaq set a new record high intraday. In the last two trading sessions, the three major indices each recorded new record-highs, with market participants optimistic of a relatively quick rollout of a vaccine and additional fiscal stimulus. 

Last Friday, the Labor Department released their November jobs report, which showed the slowest pace of job growth since April’s record spike in unemployment. Non-farm payrolls grew by just 245,000, much lower than the 460,000 expected. The deceleration in recovery is likely due to the record spike in infections recently and the reimposition of certain restrictions across the United States. In an effort to support the economy, a bipartisan group of Senators unveiled a new stimulus proposal worth $908 billion, a sum greater than the ceiling Senate Leader Mitch McConnel (Rep.) set but below the Democrat’s original $2 billion proposal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Dem.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Dem.) have indicated they support the proposal and Senator Bill Cassidy (Rep.) told Fox News he is confident the President and Senator McConnell will support the bill. We’ll have to wait and see how it plays out but we do not expect the passage of any stimulus at least until Biden’s administration takes over.

Looking ahead, market participants will continue to eagerly follow developments on the coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to convene its outside scientific advisory board on Thursday to discuss Pfizer’s (PFE) emergency use authorization request for its vaccine. The advisors could vote as soon as that day whether to recommend that the FDA green-light the inoculation and allow the first phase of roll-outs to states. Moderna (MRNA) has also filed an emergency use authorization with the FDA. The FDA is expected to make an announcement about Moderna’s vaccine sometime this week as well. 

Despite countless calls from health officials and politicians to stay home for Thanksgiving. According to the Transportation and Security Administration (TSA), an estimated 10 million people traveled in an airplane in the week of Thanksgiving, most likely to visit family members. It seems we are now paying the consequences, with new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths reporting several new records last week. However, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn’t been seen yet. He said, “The blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we’re getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday”.

**“Most of lives greatest opportunities come out of moments of struggle; it’s up to you to make the most of these tests of creativity and character” - Ray Dalio**",129,17,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, December 7, 2020. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 7, 2020**

Stocks performed mixed today, with the S&P and Dow Jones pulling back while the tech-heavy Nasdaq set a new record high intraday. In the last two trading sessions, the three major indices each recorded new record-highs, with market participants optimistic of a relatively quick rollout of a vaccine and additional fiscal stimulus. 

Last Friday, the Labor Department released their November jobs report, which showed the slowest pace of job growth since April’s record spike in unemployment. Non-farm payrolls grew by just 245,000, much lower than the 460,000 expected. The deceleration in recovery is likely due to the record spike in infections recently and the reimposition of certain restrictions across the United States. In an effort to support the economy, a bipartisan group of Senators unveiled a new stimulus proposal worth $908 billion, a sum greater than the ceiling Senate Leader Mitch McConnel (Rep.) set but below the Democrat’s original $2 billion proposal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Dem.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Dem.) have indicated they support the proposal and Senator Bill Cassidy (Rep.) told Fox News he is confident the President and Senator McConnell will support the bill. We’ll have to wait and see how it plays out but we do not expect the passage of any stimulus at least until Biden’s administration takes over.

Looking ahead, market participants will continue to eagerly follow developments on the coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to convene its outside scientific advisory board on Thursday to discuss Pfizer’s (PFE) emergency use authorization request for its vaccine. The advisors could vote as soon as that day whether to recommend that the FDA green-light the inoculation and allow the first phase of roll-outs to states. Moderna (MRNA) has also filed an emergency use authorization with the FDA. The FDA is expected to make an announcement about Moderna’s vaccine sometime this week as well. 

Despite countless calls from health officials and politicians to stay home for Thanksgiving. According to the Transportation and Security Administration (TSA), an estimated 10 million people traveled in an airplane in the week of Thanksgiving, most likely to visit family members. It seems we are now paying the consequences, with new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths reporting several new records last week. However, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn’t been seen yet. He said, “The blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we’re getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday”.

1682198538.0,StockMarket,Inmates Running the Asylum: Low Quality Articles on Investing and Stock Picking by Journos Pretending to be Investment Analysts,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-103034245.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-103034245.html)

We know that journos are not financial analysts nor should they pretend to be. But they continue to do so with impunity. There are so many low-quality articles being written on investing and stock-picking that sometimes you feel compelled to refute them.

The above-linked article in InvestorPlace was carried by YahooFinance and came to my attention. It's a short piece on Buffett's stock picks written by a journo masquerading as some kind of stock picker. Once you examine the article and the places he's worked at, it's immediately obvious that this is a liberal arts major with no financial training who is clueless about financial statements and market data.

The article starts out by opining that Buffett bought many cyclical stocks in 2022. Then he opines that investors should ""emulate the Oracle of Omaha and snap up"" 3 Buffett stocks which may outperform the market. The stocks he has in mind are (1) Bank of America (BAC), (2) American Express (Amex), and (3) Louisiana Pacific (LPX). Let's just examine BAC since it will take too much effort to refute all three and waste time on this imbecile.

Regarding BAC, the journo notes it's trading at $27.90 (at the time) which is ""unjustified"" as BAC is a large bank that will ""benefit from deposit inflows because of worries about smaller banks."" BAC is large so will attract deposits from smaller, regional banks. So he observes BAC's earnings will rise from $3.19 in 2022 to analysts' estimate of $3.39 in 2023. Well, here's the problem: first, that's a modest 6.4% EPS growth year over year and that's good. But $3.39 is also the estimate for 2024. In other words, analysts are projecting no earnings growth from 2023 to 2024. Why do you think that's the case? That's because they expect no revenue growth from 2023 to 2024: in fact, they are projecting a revenue decline from $100.93b to $100.89b. In other words, they are projecting a standstill scenario for BAC which is more than likely a modest banking recession taking place near-term. Btw, this isn't some secret that is being guarded by the keepers of Bank America's flame: this can be gleaned from any public site like YahooFinance compiling analyst estimates:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/analysis?p=BAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/analysis?p=BAC)

But you would not know this from the misrepresentation that earnings growth will be impressive and that, given this growth, the stock price is ""unjustifiably"" low.

Let's dig deeper into this misleading claim the stock price is ""unjustifiably low."" Since this journo can't do research himself, he quotes other financial sites and claims BAC has dropped below $30 “for the first time since 2020, as Barron's cited.” I don't think he even looked at the graph himself, which should have been part of his due diligence. BAC dipped below $30 in January and February of 2021: that is, the closing prices registered were lower than $30 on at least 3 trading days during that span; intraday-wise, BAC's stock price was below $30 on at least 6 days out of the first 20 trading days in 2021. I know, because I used to watch BAC.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC?p=BAC&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC?p=BAC&.tsrc=fin-srch)

Then, BAC rose to a high of $49.38 in Feb 2022, which may have given impression that BAC was flying high and anything below $30 is abnormal. But this is how cyclical stocks, which banking stocks are, often behave, even a Systemically Important Bank (SIB) such as BAC.

When the journo claims the price dropping below $30 is so unprecedented, he implies that BAC must have been trading well above $30 for much of the last 5 years. That is not so either. Except for the 15-month period between March 2021 and May 2022, BAC traded in the low 30s. Prior to 2021, the stock was even under $18 and opened and closed below $20 in March and April of 2020 -- that was only 3 years ago. BAC was indeed a low-20 stock for much of 2020.

We know that journos are not financial analysts nor should they pretend to be. But they continue to do so with impunity. There are so many low-quality articles being written on investing and stock-picking that sometimes you feel compelled to refute them.

The above-linked article in InvestorPlace was carried by YahooFinance and came to my attention. It's a short piece on Buffett's stock picks written by a journo masquerading as some kind of stock picker. Once you examine the article and the places he's worked at, it's immediately obvious that this is a liberal arts major with no financial training who is clueless about financial statements and market data.

The article starts out by opining that Buffett bought many cyclical stocks in 2022. Then he opines that investors should ""emulate the Oracle of Omaha and snap up"" 3 Buffett stocks which may outperform the market. The stocks he has in mind are (1) Bank of America (BAC), (2) American Express (Amex), and (3) Louisiana Pacific (LPX). Let's just examine BAC since it will take too much effort to refute all three and waste time on this imbecile.

Regarding BAC, the journo notes it's trading at $27.90 (at the time) which is ""unjustified"" as BAC is a large bank that will ""benefit from deposit inflows because of worries about smaller banks."" BAC is large so will attract deposits from smaller, regional banks. So he observes BAC's earnings will rise from $3.19 in 2022 to analysts' estimate of $3.39 in 2023. Well, here's the problem: first, that's a modest 6.4% EPS growth year over year and that's good. But $3.39 is also the estimate for 2024. In other words, analysts are projecting no earnings growth from 2023 to 2024. Why do you think that's the case? That's because they expect no revenue growth from 2023 to 2024: in fact, they are projecting a revenue decline from $100.93b to $100.89b. In other words, they are projecting a standstill scenario for BAC which is more than likely a modest banking recession taking place near-term. Btw, this isn't some secret that is being guarded by the keepers of Bank America's flame: this can be gleaned from any public site like YahooFinance compiling analyst estimates:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/analysis?p=BAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/analysis?p=BAC)

But you would not know this from the misrepresentation that earnings growth will be impressive and that, given this growth, the stock price is ""unjustifiably"" low.

Let's dig deeper into this misleading claim the stock price is ""unjustifiably low."" Since this journo can't do research himself, he quotes other financial sites and claims BAC has dropped below $30 “for the first time since 2020, as Barron's cited.” I don't think he even looked at the graph himself, which should have been part of his due diligence. BAC dipped below $30 in January and February of 2021: that is, the closing prices registered were lower than $30 on at least 3 trading days during that span; intraday-wise, BAC's stock price was below $30 on at least 6 days out of the first 20 trading days in 2021. I know, because I used to watch BAC.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC?p=BAC&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC?p=BAC&.tsrc=fin-srch)

Then, BAC rose to a high of $49.38 in Feb 2022, which may have given impression that BAC was flying high and anything below $30 is abnormal. But this is how cyclical stocks, which banking stocks are, often behave, even a Systemically Important Bank (SIB) such as BAC.

When the journo claims the price dropping below $30 is so unprecedented, he implies that BAC must have been trading well above $30 for much of the last 5 years. That is not so either. Except for the 15-month period between March 2021 and May 2022, BAC traded in the low 30s. Prior to 2021, the stock was even under $18 and opened and closed below $20 in March and April of 2020 -- that was only 3 years ago. BAC was indeed a low-20 stock for much of 2020. You can call that cyclicality if you want and it happens to even the largest commercial bank in the world.

Keep them clean so you can see what matters: price, volume, levels, VWAP. That’s it.



Timeframes (simple stack):

* **Daily:** mark big levels (yesterday’s high/low, weekly levels).
* **15-min / 5-min:** intraday structure (where battles happen).
* **1-min:** entry timing (in-and-out precision).

 

Core indicators (enough already):

* **WAP** (intraday “fair-ish” price)
* **Volume bars** (is the move real or a sneeze?)
* **OPTIONAL:** 20 / 50 day moving averages for trend bias, don’t worship them.

 

What to mark before the bell:

* Yesterday’s High/Low
* Pre-market High/Low
* Obvious whole numbers (10, 20, 50)
* Gaps that might fill

**How to read it like a grown-up:**

* Rally + strong volume = real interest
* Breakout + weak volume = tourist trap
* Above the VWAP & holding = buyers are driving
* Below the VWAP & sagging = sellers got the wheel

 

**Example: Clean Breakout**

* Stock sits under yesterday’s high all morning.
* Volume starts building, price taps the level, pulls back small, then punches through on bigger volume.
* That’s your tiny setup: buy the retest that holds, take +0.7%, say thank you and goodbye.

 

**Example: Fakeouts that You Avoid**

* Same level breaks but volume is lower than the pullback.
* Pass. Let someone else donate.",2,1,"The Importance of looking at Clean Charts Having many tools don’t make you a pro, but bad tools make you dumb.
